Phases of Ethical Hacking%0A+ Following are the phass of ethical hacking%0A  + Reconnaissance%0A  + Scanning%0A  + Gaining Access%0A  + Mantaining Access%0A  + Clearing Tracks%0A  %0A%0A#### 6.1 Reconnaissance%0A+ First stage in methodolgy oh hacking%0A+ This is the stage in which hacker collects information about the target.%0A+ Also known as %60Footprinting%60 or %60Information Gathering%60%0A+ As much information as possible is collected.%0A+ The information can be divided in three groups:%0A  + Network Infomation%0A  + Host Information%0A  + People Involved%0A+ Types: %60Active%60 and %60Passive%60%0A%0A#### 6.1.1 Types of Reconnaissance%0A  + %60Active%60 %0A    + Directly interacting with the traget to gather information%0A    + Eg.: using Nmap tool to scan the target%0A  + %60Passive%60%0A    + Collecting infformation without accessing the target directly.%0A    + Involves collection from website, social media etc.%0A%0A#### 6.1.2 Tools and Methods used%0A+   Various different methods are used to gather information some are%0A    +   Google hacking%0A    +   Harverster%0A    +   WHOIS %0A    +   Social Engineering%0A    +   Footprinting%0A    +   Website Footprinting%0A%0A%0A#### 6.1.2.1 Google Hacking%0A+ Using google directives to gather information about target.%0A+ %60Google Directives%60%0A  + These are keywords that allows to extract infomation from google index more accurately.%0A+ It depends on following 3 elements:%0A  + name of directive%0A  + a colon%0A  + term to search/use in directive%60%0A  + Eg.: %60inurl: admin%60%0A+ Types of google directive:%0A  1. %60Site directive%60%0A       + Search only one website or domain.%0A  2. %60Inurl directive%60%0A       + Return all the website that contains the searched term in their url%0A  3. %60Intitle/Allintitle directive%60%0A     + Return all the website that contains the searched term in the title of webpage%0A  4. %60Filetype directive%60%0A       + Used to search for a specific filetypes extension%0A  + %60Combined directive%60%0A      + More than one google directives can be combine to get even more accurate result%0A#### 6.1.2.2 Harvester%0A+ Process of cataloging quickly and accurately  both%0A  + email &%0A  + subdomains related to a target%0A+ It can be done simply be an effective python script.%0A#### 6.1.2.3 WHOIS%0A+ It is the process of obtaining additional information such as%0A  + IP address%0A  + Hostname of DNS server%0A  + Contact Information%0A  + Address%0A  + Email and phone number%0A+ It can easily be performed on linux using %60whois target_domain%60%0A+ Only the domain name is required.%0A%0A#### 6.1.2.4 Social Engineering%0A+ Art of mainpulating computer user to reveal sensitive information%0A+ Also includes activities such as exploiting human kindness, greed, curiosity%0A+ To trick users to gain access to restricted building or%0A+ Getting users to install backdoor%0A%0A#### 6.1.2.5 Footprinting%0A+ Process of gathering data regarding a specifig netwrok environment%0A+ For the purpose of revealing system vulnerabilities%0A+ It provides a blueprint of the target ystem or network.%0A+ Footprinting usage various security technologies, such as%0A  + DNS queries%0A  + Netwrok queries%0A  + Netwrok Enmuneration%0A  + OS identification%0A  + Ping sweep%0A  + Port scanning%0A%0A#### 6.1.2.6 Website Footprinting%0A+ Process of extracting as much information as possible from/about the website%0A+ The informations that can be:%0A  + Archived description of website%0A  + CMS and framewoek in use%0A  + Platform and webserver in use%0A  + Web crawling%0A  + Metadata and contact details%0A  + Website & Webpage monitoring and analysing.%0A%0A#### 6.2 Scanning%0A+ Process of locating systems that are alive/online and are responding on network.%0A+ Then scannig it for information or vulnerabilites.%0A+ Scanning is done into three steps:%0A  + Determining if system is alive%0A  + Port Scanning%0A  + Vulnerability Scanning%0A#### 6.2.1 Network Scanning for system status%0A+ The process determines wheter the system the system is on and%0A+ Capable of communicating with our machine or not.%0A#### 6.2.2 Port Scanning%0A+ It is the process of identifying the specific ports and services on a particular machine/host.%0A+ A port is a data connection that allows a computer to exchange information on netwrok.%0A+ It proves a way for software to commnicate with hardware.%0A+ Computer allows use of multiple ports corresponding to their respective services%0A+ Total number of ports: 65536%0A+ Types of ports: %60UDP%60 & %60TCP%60%0A+ Tools: %60nmap%60%0A+ Common Ports are:%0A%0A%7CPort Number%7CServices%7C%0A%7C:-%7C:-%7C%0A%7C20%7CFTP (Data Transfer)%7C%0A%7C21%7CFTP (Control)%7C%0A%7C22%7CSSH%7C%0A%7C23%7CTelnet%7C%0A%7C25%7CSMTP%7C%0A%7C53%7CDNS%7C%0A%7C80%7CHTTP%7C%0A%7C443%7CHTTPS%7C%0A%0A#### 6.2.3 Vulnerability  Scanning%0A+  Vulnerability scanning is thhe process of finding weakness in software and system configuration%0A+ These are then exploited to get unauthorized access%0A+ They come in many forms but mostly are missin vendor patches.%0A+ Pathches are relesed to fix known security flaw.%0A+ Tools such as %60Nessus%60 is used for vulnarabllty scanning. %0A%0A#### 6.3 Gaining Access%0A#### 6.4 Mantaining Access%0A#### 6.5 Clearing
