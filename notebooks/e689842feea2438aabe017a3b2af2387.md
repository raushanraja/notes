### 1.1 Remote Sensing
+ The science of acquiring information about earth without actually being in contact with it.
+ Done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy.
+ Then processing analyzing and applying that information.

<br/>

### 1.2 Elements of remote sensing:
1. Energy source or Illumination
2. Radiation and the atmosphere
3. Interaction with target
4. Recording of energy by sensor
5. Transmission, Reception, and Processing
6. Interpolation and Analysis
7. Application

<br/>

#### 1.2.1. Energy source or Illumination
+ A energy source that illuminates or
+ Provides electromagnetic energy to the target of interest.


#### 1.2.2 Radiation and the Atmosphere
+ The interaction between the energy source and atmosphere which takes place when:
    + The energy travels from the source to target 
    + And when it travels from the target to the sensor.

#### 1.2.3 Interaction with target
+ The interaction that takes place with the target, after the energy source interacts with atmosphere.
+ The intercation depends upon the properties of both target and the radiation.

#### 1.2.4 Recording of energy bu the senesor
+ The energy scattered or emitted by the target after interaction is recorded.
+ The recording is done by remote sensor to record the electromagenatic radiation.

#### 1.2.5 Transmission, Reception and Processing
+ The energy recorded by the sesor is transmitted to a receiver station.
+ Transmission is ofter done in electronic form.
+ At receiving station the data is processed into an image (hardcopy and/or digital).

#### 1.2.6 Interpretation and Analysis
+ The processed image is interpreted, visually and/or digitally
+ and the information about the object is extracted through analysis.

#### 1.2.7 Application
+ The extracted information is used to better understand the object or
+ To assist in solving a particular problem.

<br/>



#### 1.3 Electromagenatic Radiation
+ The energy that illuminates the target is in the form of electromagenatic radiation.
+ All electromagenatic radiation behave in a predicatable way according to the basis of wave theory.
+ Electromagenatic radiation consists of:
    + An **electrical field**,  that varies in magnitude in direction perpendicular to dircetion of travel.
    + A **magenatic field**
    + Both these field travels at the speed of light `c`
+ Main characteristics of electromagentic radiation are:
    + Wavelength : The length of one wave cycle. `m (meters)`
    + Frequency : The number of cycles of wave passing a point per unit of time. `Hz (heryz)`
    + realtion: `c = λv`  λ= wavelength(m), v= frequency(Hz), c=3x10^8 ms
    
<br/>

##### 1.4 Electromagenatic Spectrum
+ It is the range of frequencies of electromagenatic radiation and their respective wavelength.
+ It ranges from shorter (gamma & x-rays) to longer wavelength(microwave and radio wave)
+ The regions that are useful for remote sensing are:
    |Type of radiation| Wavelength Range|
    |-|-|
    |Ultravoilet|400 nm - 1 nm|
    |Visible| 750 nm - 400 nm|
    |Infrared| 2.5 μm - 750 nm|
    |Microwaves| 25 μm - 2.5 μm|


<br/>

#### 1.5 Interaction of radiation/energy with Atmosphere
+ Before reaching to the earth's surface, the radiation travels through earths's atmosphere.
+ Particles and gases present in atmosphere can affect the incoming light and radiation.
+ There effects are cause by the mechanisms of:
    + Sacttering
    + Absorption

<br/>

##### 1.5.1 Scattering
+ Scattering is the redirection of electromagnetic radiation from its original path.
+ It is caused by the particals or large gas molecules present in amtosphere.
+ The extent of radiation depends upon factors such as:
    + Wavelength of radiation
    + Abundance of particles and gases
    + Distance that radiation travels through atmosphere
+ Types of scattering: (3)
    + Rayleigh Scattering
    + Mie Scattering
    + Nonselective Scattering

###### 1.5.1.1 Rayleigh Scattering
+ It occurs when particles are very small compared to the waveleght of radiation.
+ These could be small specks of dust or nitrogen and oxygen.
+ In this scattering, the shorter wavelength of radiation are scattered much more than longer wavelength.
+ Dominant in upper atmosphere  and causes the sky to appear blue during day.

###### 1.5.1.2 Mie Scattering
+ It occurs when particles are just about same size as the waveleght of radiation.
+ Dust, pollen, smoke, water vapours are common particles that causes this scattering.
+ It effects the longer wavelength radiation.
+ Occurs mostly in lower atmosphere.

###### 1.5.1.2 Nonselective Scattering
+ This occurs when the particles are much longer than the wavelength of radiation.
+ Water droplets, larger dust particles.
+ It scatters shorter as well as longer wavelength particles about equallu.
+ Causes fog and cloud to appear white (blue+green+red=white).

<br/>

##### 1.5.2 Absorption
+ The phenomena, causes the molecules present in atmosphere to absorb energy at various wavelength.
