### 1. GIS (Geographic Information System)
+ `definition`: 
    + It is a set of tools for 
        + collecting
        + storing
        + retriving at will
        + transforming
        + and displaying
        
    spatial data  from the real world for a particular set of purpose.
+ `Geographic information`: Information about places on earth's surface.
+ Technology ncludes:
    + GIS
    + GPS &
    + Remote Sensing

### 2. Components of a GIS
+ Hardware
+ Software
+ People
+ Insfrastructure
+ Data

#### 2.1 Hardware
+ GIS runs on whole range of computer systems,
+ Ranging from Supercomputers to handheld devices.
+ Essential elements for effective GIS operation:
    + Preprocessor
    + Sufficient main and secondary storage
    + Quality display
    + Range of IO devices

#### 2.2 Software
+ Software allows and supports important task such as
    + Data input
    + Efficient data storage
    + Data transformation
    + Analysis
    + ANd appropriate output
+ Sofware can be as simple as a browser or a complete package from GIS verdor

#### 2.3 People
+ It referes to professionals & users
+ Who define the purpose and objective
+ And provice the reason and justification for using GIS.

#### 2.4 Infrastructure
+ It refers to 
    + physical
    + origanizational
    + administrative &
    + cultural environmnet
that supports GIS operation
+ It includes:
    + requisite skills
    + data standards
    + data clearinghouse &
    + general organizational patterns.

#### 2.5 Data
+ GIS handles spatial(geographical data).
+ These data are charactrized by information about
    + position
    + connections with feature and 
    + details of non-spatial charactristics
+ It can range from megebyte to petabyte.
+ Types:
    + Geospatial Data
    + Attribute Data

##### 2.5.1 Geospatial Data
+ These data describes locations of feature, which may be discrete or continuous.
+ `Discrete Feature` : 
    + Those features that can be distinguised individually.
    + Do not exists between observation.
    + Usages vector data model
    + Example: points(well), line(road), area(land use type).
+ `Continuous Feature` :
    + Exists spatially beween two observation
    + Usages raster data model
    + Example: Elevation, Precipitaion
+ The location of spatial features on earth's surface is based on geographic coordinate system with
    + `longitude`
    + `latitude`
+ The location of map features is based on plane coordinate system with x,y coordinates.

##### 2.5.2 Attribute Data
+ Attribute data describes the characteristics of spatial features.
+ For `raster data`, each cell has a value that represents attribute of spatial feature at that location.
+ For `vector data`, the amount of attribute associated with a spatial feature can vary.
    + Eg.: A road may have `length`, `speed limit` as attribute, where as a soil polygon have a dozens of attributes.



### 3. GIS Operation
+ Spatial Data Input
    + Data acquisition
    + New data creation
    + Data edition
    + Data entry
    + Geometric Transformation 
    + Projection & Re-projection
+ Attribute Data Management
    + Data entry & verification
    + Database management
    + Attribute data Manipulation
+ Data Display
    + Map design and making
    + Cartographic symbol
+ Data Exploration
    + Using:
        + Geospatial data query
        + Attribute data query
        + data visualization
+ Data Analysis
    + Vector data analysis
    + Raster data analysis
    + path analysis
    + Geocoding
    + Spatial interpolation
    + Terrain Mapping
    + Viewshed (area of land visible from one or more observation points) and watershed (derive tropologica features such as flow direction, stream networks and boundaries)
+ GIS Modelling
    + It reffers to use of a GIS and functionalities in building model iwhth geospatial data.
    + Model is grouped into four general types:
        + Binary
            + It rely on either vector based or raster based overlay
            + It queries overlay to seperate area based on criteria satisfaction.
        + Index
            + It also rely on overlay
            + It queries overlay to create index and ranks areas based on index value.
        + Regression
            + It also rely on overlay
            + It uasges overlay to analyze relationship between dependent and independent variable
        + Process
            + It usages existing environment process knowledge and qunatified it.
            + Eg.: soil erosion prediction.
