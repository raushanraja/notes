Organization: Function, Struct, Module

## Organizing for Reuse:
- Encapsulating`behaviour` with `function`
- Encapsulation `data` with `struct`
- Exporting and Importig `moudles`
* * *

## Function:
-  Function encapsulates behaviour
-  It is code construct that call be called from different places
-  It takes parameter and retruns value to transfer data back and forth.
-  In Rust, functions are associated with struct
-  A type may have two types of function:
	-  `Associated function`: Function associated with Type instead to a particular instance
		-  `::` syntax is used to access the function.
	-  `Method` Functions associated with a particular instance of a type.
		-  `.` (dot) is used to access the function
- Syntax:
	```rust

		fn functon_name() -> return_type {
			// function body
		}

		//Example:
		fn four() -> i32 {
			4
		}
		
	```
- Parameterizing Functoins:
	- Parameters are variables that are available when function executes
	- There variable value are filled with values from the outside.
	- Few parameter types:

	| Parameter Type  | Explaination  | 
	|---|---|
	|`fn f(a: &str)` | `&`- prefix provides an immutable reference to a function. (Borrow).
	|`fn f(mut a: String)`| `mut` provides a varialbe that is mutable (Borrow).
	|`no prefix`| Simple transfer of ownership into the function. eg: `fn(a:i32)`
	|`impl`     | Prefix Allows structs/enums that implement a trait dynamically. eg: `fn(a: impl str::io::Write)`|
	|T `generic types`| T or other `generic types` are represented through letters. eg: `fn f<T>(a: T)` |

* * *
## Struct
- `struct` enacpsulates the data.
- It is use to store complex type under a single variable to ensure unformity and reusablity.
- When allocating a struct, the values for the members are required to be provided.
- Syntax:
	```rust

		struct StructName { 				// convention: struct name is CamelCase
			variable_one: type,
			variable_two: type
		}

		// Example:
		// Defining a struct
		struct Door {
			width: u32,
			height: u32,
			is_open: bool
		}

		// Using the struct
		fn main(){
			let living_room_door = Door({width:100, height:200, is_open: false});	
			println!("Is room open {}", living_room_door.is_open);
		}
		
	```
- Modifier with struct:
	- modifiers with structs are use to restrict the access to struct and its members
	- Typically `pub` is the modifier used in Rust.
	- Example:
		```rust

			pub struct Door{ 				// Makes struct accessible from outside
				width: u32,					// ❌ Not accessible from different module
				height: u32,				// ❌ Not accessible from different module
				pub is_bool: bool 				// ✔️ Accessible from different module
			}
			
		```
- Association `function` with `struct`
	- `impl` block provides function implementation for a specified struct (or even for enums).
	- A `impl` block can have multiple function.
	- It is also fine to have several `impl` blocks too.
	- `impl` is defined with the same name as struct.
	- Two types of functions in `impl` block:
		- General function that are bound to Struct and do not have instance data available to it.
			- Accessed by `::` operator
		- Instance bound function that have the instance data and can mutate the data.
			- Accessed by `.` operator
	- Example:
		```rust

			// Defining a struct	
			struct Door {
				width: u32,
				height: u32,
				is_open: bool
			}

			// Associating functions with a struct
			// impl has same name as struct
			impl Door {
				
				// General method
				// Don't have insatnce data availble to this method
				// And return type is Self, which refers to current type
				pub fn new(width: u32, height: u32, is_open: bool) -> Self {
					Door{						     
						width,   // shorthand for width:width
						height,
						is_book
					}
				}	
				
				// Instance bound method
				// first parameter is self and it can be mutable if defined with &mut 
				pub fn open(&mut self) {
					self.is_open = true;
				} 
				
				pub fn close(&mut self){
					self.is_open = false;
				}
			}
			
		```
		
## Modules: Export and Import
- Module is used to abstract code component for easy reuse.
- These modules can be used from anywhere by importting it.
- Basic Steps:
	- Create a functoin/struct/enum etc that needs to be converted into a module
	- Use `mod` keyword to declare it as a module
	- Use `use` keyword to get a specific thing or whole module into other file.
- Aliasing types and modules
	- using ` as ;` contruct : `use Door as Gate;`
	- using `type` keyword : `type TwoNumbers = (u64, u64);`
	- using `pub type` keyword: `pub type EmptyResult = Result<(), MyError>;*emphasized text*` 
- Different ways of creating a module:

1. Creating modules in same file using `mod` keyword
	- `mod` keyword isused with a module name, in the same file
	- `pub` keyword is used with fucntion/enun/struct which is to be exported
	- Example:
		```rust

			// Example of creating a module
			// Both module and function that is using the module are in same file.

			mod PhysicalAccessControl {		// Creating a module
				pub struct Door {
					pub width: u32,
					pub heigh: u32,
					pub is_open: bool
				}
				
				impl Door{
					pub fn new(width: 32, height: u32, is_open: bool) -> Self {
						Door{
							width,
							height,
							is_open,
						}
					}
				}
			}	

	
			// Using PhysicalAccessControl module create above in different scope
			fn main(){			
				let my_door = PhysicalAccessControl::Door::new(100, 200, false);
			}
			
		```
2. Creating module in a dedicated file
	- Create a dedicated file with required code.
	- The filename is used as module name, the module name is not defined in the module code.
	- The file which usages it need to declare the module in a `mod` statement with filename.
	- Afterward, a `use` statement enables the inclusion of module's code in current file.
	- Example:
	```rust

	   // PhysicalAccessControl.rs   <---- A dedicated file for the module 				
		pub struct Door {  	    //   <---- We are not using `mod` statement with module name here
			pub width: u32,
			pub heigh: u32,
			pub is_open: bool
		}

		impl Door{
			pub fn new(width: 32, height: u32, is_open: bool) -> Self {
				Door {
					width,
					height,
					is_open,
				}
			}
		}


		// main.rs       		       	   <----Different file which usages the module
		mod PhysicalAccessControl;  //         <---- using `mod` statement to declare the module
		use PhysicalAccessControl::Door; //    <---- using `use` statmenet to include `Door` struct

		fn main(){
			let my_door = Door::new(100, 300, false);	
		}
			
	```
3. Modules when they are in different directories (Sub-modules)
	- When modules are further divided into multiple parts and different directories.
	- Each directory needs to contain a file called `mod.rs` to create it a submodule.
	- Each new file has to be declared in `mod.rs` with `mod submodule;` keyword for `submodule.rs` file.
	- `use submodule` is used in the file where it is used.
	- The root directory contains a `lib.rs` and all top level submodules are declared in lib.rs with mod keyword.
	- Example:
	```rust

	   // PhysicalAccessControl.rs   <---- A dedicated file for the module 				
		pub struct Door {  	    //   <---- We are not using `mod` statement with module name here
			pub width: u32,
			pub heigh: u32,
			pub is_open: bool
		}

		impl Door{
			pub fn new(width: 32, height: u32, is_open: bool) -> Self {
				Door {
					width,
					height,
					is_open,
				}
			}
		}

		struct Window {    //   <---- struct private to moudle, as not using `pub` keyword
			pub width: u32,
			pub heigh: u32,
			pub is_open: bool
		}



		// main.rs   <----Different file which usages the module defined above
		mod PhysicalAccessControl;  //                 
		use PhysicalAccessControl::Door as Gate; //    <---- Aliasing import
		use PhysicalAccessControl::Window; //          <---- Fails because struct is private to module
		fn main(){
			let my_door = Gate::new(100, 300, false);	
		}
		
	```

### Enum
- User defined data types with optionally data associated with it.
- It represents that data is one fo serveral possible variants (which distinguishes it from struct)
- Useful in handing input (by giving a collection of types a name)
- https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/enums.html last stopped here

- Syntax:
	```rust
		enum name
		{
			variable1,
			variable2,
			variable3,
		}

	```
#### Operations with/on enums:
##### Matching enum vairants:
- `match` keywors can be used to match do pattern matching on enums.
- Exampld:
```rust

enum Example {
	This,
	That
}


fn matcher(x: Example){
	match x {
		Example::This => println!("We got This"),
		Example::That => println!("we got That"),
	}
}

matcher(Example::This);
mathcer(Exmaple::That);

// Output:
We got This
we got That
```

- Adding To and From string for enum
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
enum Methods {
    Register,
}


impl FromStr for Methods {
    type Err = ();

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        match s {
            "Register" => Ok(Self::Register),
            _ => Err(()),
        }
    }
}

impl fmt::Display for Methods {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        fmt::Debug::fmt(&self, f)
    }
}
