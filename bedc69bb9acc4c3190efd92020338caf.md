### 6. Phases of Ethical Hacking
+ Following are the phass of ethical hacking
  + Reconnaissance
  + Scanning
  + Gaining Access
  + Mantaining Access
  + Clearing Tracks
  

#### 6.1 Reconnaissance
+ First stage in methodolgy oh hacking
+ This is the stage in which hacker collects information about the target.
+ Also known as `Footprinting` or `Information Gathering`
+ As much information as possible is collected.
+ The information can be divided in three groups:
  + Network Infomation
  + Host Information
  + People Involved
+ Types: `Active` and `Passive`

#### 6.1.1 Types of Reconnaissance
  + `Active` 
    + Directly interacting with the traget to gather information
    + Eg.: using Nmap tool to scan the target
  + `Passive`
    + Collecting infformation without accessing the target directly.
    + Involves collection from website, social media etc.

#### 6.1.2 Tools and Methods used
+   Various different methods are used to gather information some are
    +   Google hacking
    +   Harverster
    +   WHOIS 
    +   Social Engineering
    +   Footprinting
    +   Website Footprinting


#### 6.1.2.1 Google Hacking
+ Using google directives to gather information about target.
+ `Google Directives`
  + These are keywords that allows to extract infomation from google index more accurately.
+ It depends on following 3 elements:
  + name of directive
  + a colon
  + term to search/use in directive`
  + Eg.: `inurl: admin`
+ Types of google directive:
  1. `Site directive`
       + Search only one website or domain.
  2. `Inurl directive`
       + Return all the website that contains the searched term in their url
  3. `Intitle/Allintitle directive`
     + Return all the website that contains the searched term in the title of webpage
  4. `Filetype directive`
       + Used to search for a specific filetypes extension
  + `Combined directive`
      + More than one google directives can be combine to get even more accurate result
#### 6.1.2.2 Harvester
+ Process of cataloging quickly and accurately  both
  + email &
  + subdomains related to a target
+ It can be done simply be an effective python script.
#### 6.1.2.3 WHOIS
+ It is the process of obtaining additional information such as
  + IP address
  + Hostname of DNS server
  + Contact Information
  + Address
  + Email and phone number
+ It can easily be performed on linux using `whois target_domain`
+ Only the domain name is required.

#### 6.1.2.4 Social Engineering
+ Art of mainpulating computer user to reveal sensitive information
+ Also includes activities such as exploiting human kindness, greed, curiosity
+ To trick users to gain access to restricted building or
+ Getting users to install backdoor

#### 6.1.2.5 Footprinting
+ Process of gathering data regarding a specifig netwrok environment
+ For the purpose of revealing system vulnerabilities
+ It provides a blueprint of the target ystem or network.
+ Footprinting usage various security technologies, such as
  + DNS queries
  + Netwrok queries
  + Netwrok Enmuneration
  + OS identification
  + Ping sweep
  + Port scanning

#### 6.1.2.6 Website Footprinting
+ Process of extracting as much information as possible from/about the website
+ The informations that can be:
  + Archived description of website
  + CMS and framewoek in use
  + Platform and webserver in use
  + Web crawling
  + Metadata and contact details
  + Website & Webpage monitoring and analysing.

 <br/>
 
#### 6.2 Scanning
+ Process of locating systems that are alive/online and are responding on network.
+ Then scannig it for information or vulnerabilites.
+ Scanning is done into three steps:
  + Determining if system is alive
  + Port Scanning
  + Vulnerability Scanning

 <br/>
 
#### 6.2.1 Network Scanning for system status
+ The process determines wheter the system the system is on and
+ Capable of communicating with our machine or not.
+ `Ping` is the most common method to perform this type of scanning.

##### 6.2.1.1 Ping
+ Ping is a special type of netwrok packet called ICMP packet.
+ Ping works by:
  + Sending an ICMP echo request packet to target device.
  + If device is on and not restricted to reply, it responds with exho reply packet.
+ It also gives the total time taken by packet to travel to target and return.
+ It also reports packet loss that can be helpful in determining the reliablity of netwrok
+ reply: `reply from 1.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=8md TTL=56`

##### 6.2.1.2 Ping Sweep
+ Ping sweep is a series of ping 
+ Sent automatically to a range of ip address in a network.
+ Reduces the work of sending ping to each device manually.
+ Tool used: `Fping`
+ Command Example: `fping -a -g 172.16.45.1 172.16.45.254 > hosts.txt`
  + `-a`: Show only live host
  + `-g`: Specify the range


 <br/>
 
#### 6.2.2 Port Scanning
+ It is the process of identifying the specific ports and services on a particular machine/host.
+ A port is a data connection that allows a computer to exchange information on netwrok.
+ It proves a way for software to commnicate with hardware.
+ Computer allows use of multiple ports corresponding to their respective services
+ Total number of ports: 65536Z
+ Tools: `nmap`
+ Common Ports are:

|Port Number|Services|
|:-|:-|
|20|FTP (Data Transfer)|
|21|FTP (Control)|
|22|SSH|
|23|Telnet|
|25|SMTP|
|53|DNS|
|80|HTTP|
|443|HTTPS|
+ Types of port scanning
  + TCP Connect Scan
  + TCP SYN scan
  + TCP Fin Scan
  + TCP Xmas Scan
  + TCP Null Scan
  + UDP Scan


##### 6.2.2.1 TCP Connect Scan
+ Involves completing a 3-way handshake with remote port.
+ Port is closed in full handshake is not completed.
+ Slow and methodoligical.
+ Can be detected easily and stopped using IDS/IPS system.
+ Command: `nmap -sT -p -PN 172.16.1.145`
  + `-sT` : TCP connect scan
  + `-p` : Scan all ports 
  + `-PN` : Skip host discovery phase

##### 6.2.2.2 TCP SYN Scan
+ Most common used port scanning technique due to speed and universality.
+ Also known as `half-open` scanning becuase it does not perform 3-way handshake.
+ Detect 3 out of 4 port status:
  + `open`
  + `closed`
  + `filtered`

##### 6.2.2.3 TCP FYN Scan
+ Used to determine if ports are close on system target.
+ Accomplished by sending TCP segment with FIN bit set in packet header.
+ Excepected behavious is that any TCP segment with out-of-state flag on open port is discarded.
+ Whereas on closed port is handled with `RST` in response.
+ So, when a port is closed, it sends a RST in reply to scanner.
+ Usually works on UNIX based TCP/IP.
##### 6.2.2.4 TCP Xmas Scan
+ This scan usages any combination of `SYN`, `PSH` and `URG` bit to determine the state of port (open/closed).
+ In this scan the TCP packet not containing `ACK` `RST` and `SYN` bit will result in:
  + Returning a `RST` if port is closed or
  + No response if port is open/filtered
+ Works only on the system that are RFC comliant.
+ Command: `nmap -sX -p -PN 172.16.30.200

##### 6.2.2.5 TCP Null Scan
+ In this scan all the flags are off.
+ The target returns `RST` for all closed port.
+ Can pass simple filter and access control list.
+ Command: `nmap -sN -p -PN 172.16.30.200`

##### 6.2.2.6 UDP Scan
+ This scan sends an UDP port to target.
+ If response is `ICMP port unreachable` it means port is closed.
+ No responcse can mean that port is open, but because of being connectionless protocal, the accuracy isvary with other factors.
+ Command: `namp -sU 172.16.30.200`
  
<br/>
 
#### 6.2.3 Vulnerability  Scanning
+  Vulnerability scanning is thhe process of finding weakness in software and system configuration
+ These are then exploited to get unauthorized access
+ They come in many forms but mostly are missin vendor patches.
+ Pathches are relesed to fix known security flaw.
+ Tools such as `Nessus` is used for vulnarabllty scanning.
+ `Advantage of Vul. Scanner`
  + It can easily automate the process of reconnasissance, port & sevice scanning etc.
+ `Disadvantage of Vul. Scanner`
  + It makes lots of noise by nature and can easily be detected by analyzing netwrok traffic.


 <br/>
 
#### 6.3 Gaining Access/Exploitation'
+ This step comes after the step of Scanning is completed
+ This is process of gaining administrative level access of target system,
+ This include launching exploits that allow hacker to alter original functionalty and gain accees.
+ It is the most important stage of hacking.
+ Here the hacker has the ability to perform most amount of damage possible.

 <br/>
 
#### 6.4 Mantaining Access
+ After the attacker has the access to the system, they wish to maintain the access.
+ This can be done using installing malicious software such as rootkit.
+ Maintaing access means they can access system easily next time without going to whole porcess all over again.

 <br/>
 
#### 6.5 Clearing Tracks
+ After hacker acheives their objective, they erase and hide evidence
+ Clearing track helps to avoid detection of hacking which trun up helpful in maintaining access.
+ They can delete log files that can be used to analyze and detect hacking using `CCleaner`.
+ They can files that cannot be easily detected using general sofware.
