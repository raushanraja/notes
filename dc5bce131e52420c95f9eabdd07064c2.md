Option & Result

## Option and Result Type

- Option and Result both are **enum**
    
    - Option has `Some(T)` or `None`
    - Result has `Ok(T)` or `Err(E)`
- Ways to use Option type:
    
    - Use `expect()` and `unwrap()` methods if you're sure the Option has a real value inside
    - Use `match` and `if let` to pattern match the Option
    - Use `map()` to transform the real value if it has one
    - Use `into_iter()` to transform a `Vec<Option<T>>` into an `Option<Vec<T>>`, which is useful when receiving results from many operations and you want the overall result to fail if any of the individual operations failed.
- Ways to Result type:
    
    - Use `ok_or()` and `ok()` methods to go between Result and Option
    - Use `match` and `if let` to pattern match the Result
    - Use the `?` operator to chain Result-returning functions together and return errors out of the calling function
    - Use `into_iter()` and `collect()` to transform a Vec&lt;Result<T, E&gt;> into a Result&lt;Vec<T&gt;, E>, which can be useful when dealing with many Results at once.
