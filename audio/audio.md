## Sound:
- Sound is a form of energy that is produced by vibrations.
- Sound propagatesa as an audible wave through a medium such as air or water.
- The vibrations produce changes in pressue that move through the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions.


- What's wave?
    - A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighboring particles into motion.
- What's medium?
    - A medium is a substance through which a wave can travel. Eg: Air, Water, etc.
- Sound is a form of energy that is produced by vibrations of an object.


### How sound is produced?
- Sound is produced by the vibration of an object. Eg: Guitar string, vocal cords, etc.
- When an object vibrates, it causes the medium around it to vibrate. 
- This vibration causes the medium particles to move back and forth, creating sound waves.

### How sound travels?
- Sound travels in the form of mechanical waves. Which means it requires a medium to travel.
- It travels in the form of longitudinal waves, where the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave.

### Components of Sound Wave:
- Compression: The region of high pressure in a sound wave.
- Rarefaction: The region of low pressure in a sound wave.
- Wavelength: The distance between two consecutive compressions or rarefactions.

 - sound wave is a series of alternating condensations and rarefactions. 
 The graph shows that the condensations/compressions are regions of higher than normal air pressure, 
 and the rarefactions are regions of lower than normal air pressure.

### Properties of Sound:
- Frequency: The number of vibrations per second is called the frequency of sound. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).
- Amplitude: The maximum displacement of a particle from its mean position is called the amplitude of sound.
- Speed: The speed of sound depends on the medium through which it travels. 
    - In air, sound travels at a speed of 343 m/s.
    - In water, sound travels at a speed of 1482 m/s.
    - In solids, it traves much faster than in gases or liquids.

### Frequency of Sound:
- Each cycle of a sound wave includes one compression and one rarefaction.
- The frequency of sound is the number of cycles per second that pass a given point.
- A sound with single frequency is called a pure tone.


### Human Perception of Sound:
- The human ear can detect sound waves with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.
- Sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasound, while sounds with frequencies above 20,000 Hz are called ultrasound.
- The loudness(Volume) of sound is determined by its amplitude. The greater the amplitude, the louder the sound.
- The pitch of sound is determined by its frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
- The quality of sound is determined by the presence of overtones and harmonics in the sound wave.
