body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"## String\\\n- Rust has two types to represent strings:\\\n    - String : Modifiable, owned string\\\n    - &str : A read-only String. String literal has this type. So basically the default when a string is saved in a variable.\\\n- Both type of string always stores UTF-8 encoded strings.\\\n- Raw string: `r#\\\"the actual raw string with disabled escape like:\\\\\n\\\"#;`\\\n- Creating a variable with `String` type, there are many ways but the simples is to \\\n    - use `::new()` constructor.\\\n    - Then push whatever we want to save as string.\\\n    - `let mut sentence = String::new();`\\\n    - `sentence.push_str(\\\"Hello,  world!\\\"); `\\\n- NOTE:\\\n    - Since each character is of 4bytes, indexing a string with byte position might not always work\\\n    as the byte poisition may not end  on a character boundry.\\\n    - So it's better to use iterator than trying to index by  position.\\\n    - The commented out line shows the same example where it does not end at boundry.\\\n\\\n```rust\\\nfn main() {\\\n    let greeting: &str = \\\"Greetings\\\";\\\n    let planet: &str = \\\"ü™ê\\\";\\\n    let mut sentence = String::new();\\\n    sentence.push_str(greeting);\\\n    sentence.push_str(\\\", \\\");\\\n    sentence.push_str(planet);\\\n    println!(\\\"final sentence: {}\\\", sentence);\\\n    println!(\\\"{:?}\\\", &sentence[0..5]);\\\n    //println!(\\\"{:?}\\\", &sentence[12..13]);\\\n    println!(r#\\\"<a href=\\\"link.html\\\">link</a>\\\"#);\\\n}\\\n```\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1340}]"
