It doesn't depend on anything else, not even the presence of an operating system. Core includes essential types like integers, booleans, slices, and basic operations like arithmetic and comparisons.\\\n2. **alloc**\\\n\\t- The `alloc` layer contains types that require dynamic memory allocation, such as Vec, Box, and Arc. These types need a global heap allocator to function properly. Alloc depends on core because it builds upon the fundamental types provided by core\\\n3. **std**\\\n\\t- The `std` layer is the highest-level layer of the standard library. It builds upon both core and alloc and includes a wide range of functionality, such as I/O operations, concurrency primitives, networking, filesystem manipulation, and more. It's the layer that most Rust programmers interact with on a day-to-day basis.\\\n\\\n\\\n## Documentation\\\n- Rust comes with extensive documentation. The contents of Rust file with documentation are treated as Markdown.\\\n- Most published rust librariy crate are automatically doucmanted at `doc.rs` using rustdoc.\\\n- It is idiomatic to doument all pulbic items in an api using this pattrern,\\\n\\\n### How to add documenation \\\n- To doucment an item from inside the items\\\n\\\n#### Doc Comments (///, //!):\\\n- Description: Doc comments are used to generate documentation for items like functions, structs, enums, modules, etc. They support Markdown syntax.\\\n- Pattern:\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n\\t\\t/// Description of the item.\\\n\\\n \\\n  ```\\\n\\\n- or\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n\\t\\t//! Description of the item.\\\n\\t\\t\\\n \\\n  ```\\\n\\\n#### Regular Comments (//, /* */):\\\n- Description: Regular comments are used for non-documentation purposes, such as clarifying code logic or providing implementation details.\\\n- Pattern:\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n\\t\\t// This is a regular comment.\\\n\\t\\t\\\n \\\n  ```\\\n\\\n#### Function Documentation:\\\n- Keywords: `///`,`Args`, `Returns`, `Examples`.\\\n- Pattern:\\\n\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n\\t\\t/// Brief description of the function.\\\n\\t\\t///\\\n\\t\\t/// # Arguments\\\n\\t\\t/// * `arg1`: Description of argument 1.\\\n\\t\\t/// * `arg2`: Description of argument 2.\\\n\\t\\t/// # Returns\\\n\\t\\t/// Description of the return value.\\\n\\t\\t/// # Examples\\\n\\t\\t/// ```\\\n\\t\\t/// let result = my_function(arg1, arg2);\\\n\\t\\t///\\\n\\\n \\\n  ```\\\n\\\n#### Struct and Enum Documentation:\\\n- Keywords: ///, Fields, Variants.\\\n- Pattern:\\\n\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n\\t\\t/// Brief description of the struct or enum.\\\n\\t\\t///\\\n\\t\\t/// # Fields\\\n\\t\\t/// * `field1`: Description of field 1.\\\n\\t\\t/// * `field2`: Description of field 2.\\\n\\\n\\\n  ```\\\n\\\n- or\\\n\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n    /// Brief description of the enum.\\\n    ///\\\n    /// # Variants\\\n    /// * `Variant1`: Description of Variant1.\\\n    /// * `Variant2`: Description of Variant2.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\t```\\\n#### Module-Level Documentation:\\\n- Keywords: ///, Modules, Re-exports.\\\n- Pattern:\\\n\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\\n    /// Brief description of the module.\\\n    ///\\\n    /// # Modules\\\n    /// * `submodule1`: Description of submodule1.\\\n    /// * `submodule2`: Description of submodule2.\\\n    /// # Re-exports\\\n    /// ```\\\n    /// pub use submodule1::Item;\\\n    /// ```\\\n\\\n\\\n```\\\n\\\nExample Usage:\\\n\\\n    Keywords: ///, Examples.\\\n    Pattern:\\\n\\\n    rust\\\n\\\n        /// Brief description of the function.\\\n        ///\\\n        /// # Examples\\\n        /// ```\\\n        /// let result = my_function(arg1, arg2);\\\n        /// ```\\\n\\\nThese patterns and keywords help maintain consistency and clarity in Rust documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the codebase.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3602}]"
