## Recursion
+ When a method calls itself directly or indirectly.
+ During recursion memory is allocated on stack.
+ A wrong/no base condition may cause Stack Overflow error.
+ A Stack Overflow occurs when the stack memory gets exhausted.

### Base condition
+ Base condition is the case which stops the functions to call itself further from that point. 
+ From this point all the smaller results found are combined to form the single largest result.

### Types:
+ Tailed : Recursive statement is the last executed statement of function.
+ Non-Tailed : Recursive statement is not the last statement.

### Usages of recursion:
+ Tower of Hanoi
+ Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversal
+ DFS of Graph
