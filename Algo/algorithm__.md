# Algorithm

+ Algorithm is well defined list of steps for solving a particular problem.
+ <strong>Comlpexity of an Agorithm</strong> is a the function which gives the
running time and/or space of the input size.

## Types of Algorithm

+ Greedy Algorithm
+ Divide & Conquer Algorithm
+ Dynamic Algorithm

## Performance Analysis

1. Space Complexity
2. Time Complexity

+ <strong>Time Complexity</strong>
  + Best Case
  + Worst Case
  + Average Case
