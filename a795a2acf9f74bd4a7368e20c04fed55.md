Basic Introduction**\\\n\\\n- A Python testing framework\\\n- Allow to create small test and support for complex functional testing\\\n- Install `pip install pytest`\\\n- Some Conventions:\\\n    - **File Naming**: The test files should be named as `test_*.py`\\\n    - **Function Naming**: THe Function within these files need to start with `test_`\\\n    - **Class Naming**: The Class name should also start with `Test_`\\\n        - Must not have an `__int__` method\\\n        - All method should follow `Function Naming` convention\\\n    - **FIle Organization**: Test should be seperated into different files based on what they are testing.\\\n    - Example:\\\n        \\\n        ```python\\\n        # Function Naming:\\\n        def test_my_function():\\\n            assert my_function() == expected_result\\\n        \\\n        # Class Naming:\\\n        class TestMyFunction:\\\n            def test_case1(self):\\\n                assert my_function(1) == expected_result1\\\n        \\\n            def test_case2(self):\\\n                assert my_function(2) == expected_result2\\\n        ```\\\n        \\\n\\\n**2\\\\. Pytest Common Options Usages**\\\n\\\n- `pytest` : To run the test, run in the directory where test files Or `tests` directory exists\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -v` : To Increase verbosity\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -k Expression`: Only run tests which matches given substring expression\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -m mark`: Only run tests which has `mark` added in test\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -x` : Exit instantly on first error or failed test.\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -ff`: Run the filutes from last run first.\\\n    \\\n- `pytest -s` : Do not capture (Pirnt directly to console)\\\n    \\\n- `pytest --junitxml=path`: Create a JUnit-XML styel report file at given path.\\\n    \\\n- Example Usages\\\n    \\\n    ```bash\\\n    pytest -k \\\"addition\\\" # Runs tests whose function name has addition in it.\\\n    pytest -k \\\"addition or sub\\\" # Name has addition  or sub in it.\\\n    pytest -k \\\"addition and sub\\\" # Name has both addition and sub in it. \\\n    pytest --junitxml=path/to/report.xml # Save the result to given xml file\\\n    pytest -m number # Runs the test below with a mark added to it\\\n    \\\n    \\\n    python Code:\\\n    import pytest\\\n    \\\n    @pytest.mark.number # Adding the mark here\\\n    def test_addition():\\\n        assert 0+2 == 2\\t\\\n    \\\n    \\\n    ```\\\n\\t\\\n\\\n### Sharing fixtures across multiple test files\\\n- Define the fixtures in `conftest.py`\\\n\\\n\\\n### Conftest.py\\\n- \"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2348}]"
