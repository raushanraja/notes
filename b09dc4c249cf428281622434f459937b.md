Comparators\\\n\\\n- In rust comparision operator like (`==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are implemented through traits rather than built-in operator.\\\n- `#[derive]` Can be used to automatically derive comparison traits for custom type, as long as the fields within those custom type also implement comparison traits.\\\n- These traits are called Comparator and actual traits responsieble for this are \\\n\\t- `PartialEq`  \\\n\\t- `PartialOrd`\\\n\\t- `Ord`\\\n\\\n### 1.1 PartialEq trait\\\n- Used for testing equalitry between two values.\\\n- Defines `eq` and `ne` method for checking if they are equal or not.\\\n- The `==` and `!=`operators will call these methods.\\\n\\\n### 1.2 PartialOrd trait \\\n- Used for comparing values. \\\n- It defines methods like lt (less than), le (less than or equal), gt (greater than), and ge (greater than or equal).\\\n- The  `<`, `<=`,  `>=` , and `>` operators.\\\n\\\n### 1.3 Ord trait\\\n- Defines a strict ordering between values, and it returns an `Ordering` enum from the `cmp` method.\\\n- The Ordering enum has three variants:\\\n\\t- `Less`: Indicates that the first value is less than the second.\\\n    - `Equal`: Indicates that the two values are equal.\\\n    - `Greater`: Indicates that the first value is greater than the second.\"]],\"start1\":110,\"start2\":110,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":1222}]"
