#### Design Patterns:
- Design patterns are reusable solution to common software design problems.
- These provide an efficient and maintainable way to solve problems.


#### Most common Design Patterns in python
- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioural Patterns
- Concurrency Patterns
- Idiomatic Patterns


#### Creational Patterns
- These patterns are related to object creational mechanisms.
- Trying to create objects in a suitalbe manner to the situation.
- Most common creational patterns:
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton


#### Structural Patterns
- These patterns focuses on organizing and composing objects and form larger structure.
- Most common Structural Patterns:
    - Composite
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Proxy
    - Flyweight


#### Behavioural Patterns
- These patterns address how 
    - Object/classes communicate & collabrate with each other and
    - Assignment of responsibilites between objects
- This pattern deals with algorithms rather than the structure of the code
- Most common Behavioural Patterns:
    - Observer 
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - State
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento 
    - Visitor
    - Template Method


#### Concurrency Patterns
- These pattern address challanges of
    - design and managing concurrent and parallel execution
    in multi-threaded or destributed system
- This pattern helps in ensuring that
    - Thread or Process work together efficiently and safely
    - Avoid issues like race-condition and resource contention
- Helps in designing reliabl, responsive and scalable systems
- Most common Concurrency Patterns:
    - Producer-Consumer pattern
    - Semaphore 
    - Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
    - Read-Write Lock 
    - Thread Pool
    - Future & Promise
    - Barrier
    - Actor Model


#### Idiomatic Patterns
- Idiomatic : Confirming to customary way of doing things.
- Idiomatic Patterns are
    - established conventions and best practices in a specific programming language or framework. 
- These represents most natural, readable, consistent and efficient way to do things.
- Example:
    - Python's list comprehension
    - Naming conventions for codes in a specific language
    - Using map/filter in javascript
