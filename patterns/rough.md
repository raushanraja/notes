- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioural Patterns
- Concurrency Patterns
- Idiomatic Patterns

Sure, here are some of the most common design patterns in each category along with examples:
Creational Patterns:

    Singleton Pattern:
        Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
        Example: Database connections, Logger classes.

    Factory Method Pattern:
        Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
        Example: GUI libraries where different platforms have different implementations for creating buttons.

    Abstract Factory Pattern:
        Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
        Example: Creating different types of GUI components like buttons, windows, and menus.

    Builder Pattern:
        Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
        Example: Building complex documents, such as HTML or XML.

    Prototype Pattern:
        Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
        Example: Cloning objects in a game to create multiple enemies with similar attributes.

Structural Patterns:

    Adapter Pattern:
        Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
        Example: Adapting an old API to work with a new one.

    Decorator Pattern:
        Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
        Example: Adding toppings to a pizza.

    Composite Pattern:
        Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
        Example: Representing a hierarchical menu system.

    Proxy Pattern:
        Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
        Example: Lazy loading of images on a web page.

    Bridge Pattern:
        Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
        Example: Implementing different rendering engines for shapes in a drawing application.

Behavioral Patterns:

    Observer Pattern:
        Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
        Example: Event handling in graphical user interfaces.

    Strategy Pattern:
        Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
        Example: Sorting algorithms in a sorting library.

    Command Pattern:
        Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queuing, requests, and operations.
        Example: Remote control for electronic devices.

    State Pattern:
        Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
        Example: Implementing a turnstile with different states (locked, unlocked).

    Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
        Passes the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
        Example: Implementing input validation where multiple validators can handle different aspects of validation.

Concurrency Patterns:

    Producer-Consumer Pattern:
        Deals with the efficient distribution of work among multiple threads.
        Example: A thread pool handling incoming tasks.

    Semaphore Pattern:
        Manages access to a limited resource by multiple threads.
        Example: Limiting the number of concurrent connections to a database.

    Mutex Pattern:
        Ensures that only one thread accesses a resource at a time.
        Example: Protecting critical sections of code.

Idiomatic Patterns:

    Null Object Pattern:
        Provides an object as a surrogate for the lack of an object of a given type.
        Example: Providing a default implementation when an object is missing.

    Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) Pattern:
        Binds the lifecycle of a resource to the scope of an object.
        Example: Using C++ smart pointers to manage memory.

These are some of the most common design patterns in each category. Design patterns provide proven solutions to common software design problems and are essential for creating maintainable and extensible code.

Structural Pattern defnintaion/ explain 

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. These patterns deal with relationships between objects, making it easier to design systems by defining how different components can work together to achieve a larger goal. They help in achieving flexibility, reusability, and maintainability by providing a clear and organized way to create object structures.

Here are some key aspects of structural design patterns:

    Composition: Structural patterns are primarily concerned with composing objects and classes to create larger structures. This composition can be achieved through inheritance, interfaces, or aggregations.

    Flexibility: These patterns allow for flexibility in changing the composition of objects or classes without affecting the overall system. This makes it easier to modify and extend the system.

    Reusability: By defining clear interfaces and relationships between components, structural patterns promote code reuse. This leads to more efficient development and easier maintenance.

    Clarity: These patterns provide a clear and understandable way to represent complex structures and relationships in software systems. This clarity enhances the comprehensibility of the codebase.

    Separation of Concerns: They help in separating the concerns of different parts of a system. By clearly defining the interactions and responsibilities of components, structural patterns contribute to a more modular and organized design.

Here are a few examples of structural design patterns:

    Adapter Pattern: This pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It's often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

    Decorator Pattern: The decorator pattern is used to add new responsibilities to objects dynamically without altering their structure. It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

    Composite Pattern: This pattern is used to treat both individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It allows clients to work with individual objects and compositions of objects in a consistent manner.

    Proxy Pattern: The proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It's useful for scenarios where you want to add a level of control, such as lazy loading or access control, to an object.

    Bridge Pattern: The bridge pattern separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This helps in managing complex hierarchies of classes.

    Flyweight Pattern: The flyweight pattern is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects. It's often used in scenarios where a large number of similar objects need to be created efficiently.

These structural design patterns are essential tools in a software developer's toolbox, as they provide solutions to recurring design problems related to the organization and composition of classes and objects in a system.

Structural design patterns in software engineering focus on organizing and composing objects and classes to form larger structures. They provide ways to:

    Compose Objects: Combine classes and objects to create more complex structures.

    Enhance Flexibility: Make it easier to modify and extend the system without affecting its core components.

    Promote Reusability: Encourage the reuse of components by defining clear interfaces and relationships.

    Clarify Code: Improve code comprehensibility by representing complex structures and relationships in a clear manner.

    Separate Concerns: Divide system concerns and responsibilities into manageable modules.

Examples include the Adapter Pattern (interface conversion), Decorator Pattern (dynamic responsibility addition), Composite Pattern (treat individual and composed objects uniformly), and others. These patterns help solve common design challenges and improve software maintainability.

Behavioural Pattern

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on the communication and collaboration between objects or classes. They address how objects interact and communicate with one another, helping to manage the flow of responsibilities in a more flexible and efficient way. These patterns enable you to create systems that are more understandable, maintainable, and extensible by defining clear and reusable communication patterns.

Here are some key aspects of behavioral design patterns:

    Object Interaction: Behavioral patterns deal with the interactions and responsibilities among objects and classes, defining how they collaborate to achieve specific tasks.

    Flexibility: They promote flexibility by providing guidelines for organizing and managing object interactions, making it easier to adapt and modify a system's behavior.

    Encapsulation: These patterns often encapsulate the behavior of objects or components, reducing the dependencies between them and promoting a more modular design.

    Reusability: By defining standard ways for objects to communicate, behavioral patterns encourage the reuse of these communication patterns in various parts of a system.

    Isolation of Concerns: They help in isolating and managing specific concerns or responsibilities within a system, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Here are a few examples of behavioral design patterns:

    Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It's commonly used for implementing distributed event handling systems.

    Strategy Pattern: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows you to select an algorithm's implementation at runtime. This is useful when you want to switch between different algorithms without changing the client code.

    Command Pattern: The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queuing, requests, and operations. It's often used for implementing undo/redo functionality and command queues.

    State Pattern: The state pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It's useful when an object needs to change its behavior based on its internal state, and this behavior can be represented as a set of discrete states.

    Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. It's useful for implementing a pipeline of processing steps.

    Interpreter Pattern: The interpreter pattern is used for interpreting a language or expressions. It defines a grammar for the language and provides an interpreter that can parse and execute expressions in that language.

These behavioral design patterns are powerful tools for managing the interactions and behaviors of objects in a software system. They help you design systems that are more modular, flexible, and maintainable by promoting clear communication patterns between objects.

Concurrency Patterns:

Concurrency design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that address the challenges of designing and managing concurrent and parallel execution in multi-threaded or distributed systems. These patterns help ensure that threads or processes work together efficiently and safely, avoiding issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and resource contention. Concurrency patterns enable developers to design concurrent systems that are reliable, responsive, and scalable.

Here are some key points about concurrency design patterns:

    Parallel Execution: Concurrency patterns deal with the simultaneous execution of tasks by multiple threads or processes, often for improved performance.

    Safety and Synchronization: They focus on ensuring that concurrent activities do not interfere with each other and that shared resources are accessed safely.

    Efficiency: These patterns aim to make the most efficient use of available resources (e.g., CPU cores) while minimizing contention and synchronization overhead.

    Scalability: Concurrency patterns should allow a system to scale and utilize additional resources as needed to handle increased workloads.

    Resilience: They help in designing systems that can recover gracefully from concurrency-related failures and errors.

Here are some examples of concurrency design patterns:

    Producer-Consumer Pattern: This pattern addresses the efficient distribution of work among multiple threads or processes. It typically involves a shared buffer where producers add data, and consumers retrieve and process it.

    Semaphore Pattern: Semaphores are used to manage access to a limited set of resources, allowing a specified number of threads to access those resources concurrently.

    Mutex Pattern (Mutual Exclusion): Mutexes provide exclusive access to a resource or section of code, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time, preventing data corruption.

    Read-Write Lock Pattern: This pattern allows multiple threads to read a shared resource simultaneously but ensures that only one thread can write to the resource at a time.

    Thread Pool Pattern: A thread pool manages a group of worker threads that can execute tasks concurrently. It helps in efficiently reusing threads and controlling the number of concurrent tasks.

    Futures and Promises: Futures and promises enable asynchronous programming by representing the result of an operation that may not have completed yet. They allow a thread to continue working on other tasks while waiting for a result.

    Barrier Pattern: Barriers are synchronization points that allow a group of threads to wait until all threads have reached the barrier before continuing execution. They are useful for tasks that need to synchronize at specific points.

    Actor Model: The actor model is a high-level model for concurrent computation. It involves independent, stateful actors that communicate with each other through message passing, making it easier to reason about concurrency.

These concurrency design patterns provide solutions to common challenges associated with multi-threaded and distributed systems, ensuring that concurrent execution is both efficient and safe.

- Idiomatic Patterns

Short  , consice

Idiomatic patterns in software development are best practices or conventions that reflect the typical or preferred way of writing code in a particular programming language or framework. They help developers write code that is clear, efficient, and consistent with the language's style and culture. These patterns are often language-specific and are followed to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some key points about idiomatic patterns:

    Best Practices: Idiomatic patterns represent the best practices and conventions in a programming language or framework.

    Clarity: They aim to improve code clarity, making it easier for other developers to understand and work with the codebase.

    Consistency: Idiomatic patterns promote consistency in code style and structure, which is important for collaboration and maintenance.

    Efficiency: Following idiomatic patterns can lead to more efficient code, as they often leverage the language's features effectively.

    Language-Specific: These patterns are specific to a particular programming language or framework and may vary from one language to another.

Examples of idiomatic patterns include using Python's list comprehensions for concise iteration, following Java naming conventions for classes and methods, and using functional programming constructs like map and filter in JavaScript. These patterns are an essential part of writing code that is both effective and easy to work with in a given programming ecosystem.

Define - Idiomatic Patterns

Idiomatic patterns, in the context of software development, refer to established conventions and best practices within a specific programming language or framework. These conventions represent the most natural, readable, and efficient way to write code within that particular language's culture and style.

In essence, idiomatic patterns guide developers on how to write code that aligns with the norms and standards of the chosen programming language or framework, promoting code that is clear, maintainable, and consistent with the expectations of others who work with that code. These patterns are language-specific and aim to make the codebase more understandable, coherent, and idiomatic, meaning it conforms to the customary way of writing code in a given context.
