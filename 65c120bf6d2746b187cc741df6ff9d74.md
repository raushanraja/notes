Each pattern will be tested in left-to-right sequence until a successful match is found.\\\n- Every binding in each `|` separated pattern must appear in all of the patterns in the arm. Every binding of the same name must have the same type, and have the same binding mode.\\\n- The 2..=9 is a [Range Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/patterns.html#range-patterns), not a Range Expression. Thus, only those types of ranges supported by range patterns can be used in match arms.\\\n- Example:\\\n\\t```rust\\\n\\tlet x = 9;\\\n\\tlet message = match x {\\\n\\t\\t0 | 1  => \\\"not many\\\",\\\n\\t\\t2 ..= 9 => \\\"a few\\\",\\\n\\t\\t_      => \\\"lots\\\"\\\n\\t};\\\n\\\n\\tassert_eq!(message, \\\"a few\\\");\\\n\\\n\\t// Demonstration of pattern match order.\\\n\\tstruct S(i32, i32);\\\n\\\n\\tmatch S(1, 2) {\\\n\\t\\tS(z @ 1, _) | S(_, z @ 2) => assert_eq!(z, 1),\\\n\\t\\t_ => panic!(),\\\n\\t}\\\n\\t```\\\n\\\n\\\n\"],[0,\"### if-l\"]],\"start1\":11766,\"start2\":11766,\"length1\":16,\"length2\":912}]"
