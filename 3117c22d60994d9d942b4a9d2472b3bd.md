2_5_Standard_Library_Types

## 1. Standard Library
- Rust comes with standard library which helps establish a set of common types used by Rust Libraries and programs.
- Rust contains severl layers of Standard Libraries there are:
	1. `core`
	2. `alloc`
	3. `std`
1. **core**
	- This layer provides the most fundamental types and functions in Rust. It doesn't depend on anything else, not even the presence of an operating system. Core includes essential types like integers, booleans, slices, and basic operations like arithmetic and comparisons.
2. **alloc**
	- The `alloc` layer contains types that require dynamic memory allocation, such as Vec, Box, and Arc. These types need a global heap allocator to function properly. Alloc depends on core because it builds upon the fundamental types provided by core
3. **std**
	- The `std` layer is the highest-level layer of the standard library. It builds upon both core and alloc and includes a wide range of functionality, such as I/O operations, concurrency primitives, networking, filesystem manipulation, and more. It's the layer that most Rust programmers interact with on a day-to-day basis.


## 2. Documentation
- Rust comes with extensive documentation. The contents of Rust file with documentation are treated as Markdown.
- Most published rust librariy crate are automatically doucmanted at `doc.rs` using rustdoc.
- It is common to doument all pulbic items in an api using this pattrern,

### How to add documenation 

### i).  Doc Comments (///, //!):
- Description: Doc comments are used to generate documentation for items like functions, structs, enums, modules, etc. They support Markdown syntax.
- Pattern:
	```rust

		/// Description of the item.

 
  ```

- or
	```rust

		//! Description of the item.
		
 
  ```

### II). Regular Comments (//, /* */):
- Description: Regular comments are used for non-documentation purposes, such as clarifying code logic or providing implementation details.
- Pattern:
	```rust

		// This is a regular comment.
		
 
  ```

#### III). Function Documentation:
- Keywords: `///`,`Args`, `Returns`, `Examples`.
- Pattern:

	```rust

		/// Brief description of the function.
		///
		/// # Arguments
		/// * `arg1`: Description of argument 1.
		/// * `arg2`: Description of argument 2.
		/// # Returns
		/// Description of the return value.
		/// # Examples
		/// ```
		/// let result = my_function(arg1, arg2);
		///

 
  ```

### iv). Struct and Enum Documentation:
- Keywords: ///, Fields, Variants.
- Pattern:

	```rust

		/// Brief description of the struct or enum.
		///
		/// # Fields
		/// * `field1`: Description of field 1.
		/// * `field2`: Description of field 2.


  ```

- or

	```rust

		/// Brief description of the enum.
		///
		/// # Variants
		/// * `Variant1`: Description of Variant1.
		/// * `Variant2`: Description of Variant2.


	```
### v). Module-Level Documentation:
- Keywords: ///, Modules, Re-exports.
- Pattern:

	```rust

		/// Brief description of the module.
		///
		/// # Modules
		/// * `submodule1`: Description of submodule1.
		/// * `submodule2`: Description of submodule2.
		/// # Re-exports
		/// ```
		/// pub use submodule1::Item;
		/// ```


	```

### vi). Example Usage:
- Keywords: ///, Examples.
- Pattern:

    ```rust

		/// Brief description of the function.
		///
		/// # Examples
		/// ```
		/// let result = my_function(arg1, arg2);
		/// ```


	```

## Common Rust STD Library Types:
- `Option<T>`: It stores either a value of type T or nothing
- `Resutl<T,E>`: Similar to `option<T>`,  indicates the success or failure of an operation.
- `String`: `String` is standard heap-allocated growable UTF-8 string buffer.
- `Vec`: `Vec` is standard resizable heap-allocated  buffer.
- `HashMap`: `HashMap` is standard hash map with protecteion against HashDos attacks.
- `String`, `Vec` and `HashMap` is type of collection. The data there collections contains are stored on heap.This means the amount of data doesn't need to be known at compile time and it can grow and shrink at runtime.
