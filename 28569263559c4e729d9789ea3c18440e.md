Each pattern will be tested in left-to-right sequence until a successful match is found.\\\n- Every binding in each `|` separated pattern must appear in all of the patterns in the arm.\\\n- Every binding of the same name must have the same type, and have the same binding mode.\\\n- The 2..=9 is a [Range Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/patterns.html#range-patterns), not a Range Expression. Thus, only those types of ranges supported by range patterns can be used in match arms.\\\n- Example:\\\n    \\\n    ```rust\\\n    let x = 9;\\\n    let message = match x {\\\n        0 | 1  => \\\"not many\\\",\\\n        2 ..= 9 => \\\"a few\\\",\\\n        _      => \\\"lots\\\"\\\n    };\\\n    \\\n    assert_eq!(message, \\\"a few\\\");\\\n    \\\n    // Demonstration of pattern match order.\\\n    struct S(i32, i32);\\\n    \\\n    match S(1, 2) {\\\n        S(z @ 1, _) | S(_, z @ 2) => assert_eq!(z, 1),\\\n        _ => panic!(),\\\n    }\\\n    ```\\\n    \\\n\\\n### if-let\\\n\\\n### let-else\\\n\\\n### while-let\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":15183}]"
