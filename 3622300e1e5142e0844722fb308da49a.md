# Pytest:

**1\. Basic Introduction**

- A Python testing framework
- Allow to create small test and support for complex functional testing
- Install `pip install pytest`
- Some Conventions:
    - **File Naming**: The test files should be named as `test_*.py`
        
    - **Function Naming**: THe Function within these files need to start with `test_`
        
    - **Class Naming**: The Class name should also start with `Test_`
        
        - Must not have an `__int__` method
        - All method should follow `Function Naming` convention
    - **FIle Organization**: Test should be seperated into different files based on what they are testing.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        # Function Naming:
        def test_my_function():
            assert my_function() == expected_result
        
        # Class Naming:
        class TestMyFunction:
            def test_case1(self):
                assert my_function(1) == expected_result1
        
            def test_case2(self):
                assert my_function(2) == expected_result2
        ```
        

**2\. Pytest Common Options Usages**

- `pytest` : To run the test, run in the directory where test files Or `tests` directory exists
    
- `pytest -v` : To Increase verbosity
    
- `pytest -k Expression`: Only run tests which matches given substring expression
    
- `pytest -m mark`: Only run tests which has `mark` added in test
    
- `pytest -x` : Exit instantly on first error or failed test.
    
- `pytest -ff`: Run the filutes from last run first.
    
- `pytest -s` : Do not capture (Pirnt directly to console)
    
- `pytest --junitxml=path`: Create a JUnit-XML styel report file at given path.
    
- Example Usages
    
    ```bash
    pytest -k "addition" # Runs tests whose function name has addition in it.
    pytest -k "addition or sub" # Name has addition  or sub in it.
    pytest -k "addition and sub" # Name has both addition and sub in it. 
    pytest --junitxml=path/to/report.xml # Save the result to given xml file
    pytest -m number # Runs the test below with a mark added to it
    
    
    python Code:
    import pytest
    
    @pytest.mark.number # Adding the mark here
    def test_addition():
        assert 0+2 == 2	
    
    
    ```
    

### Sharing fixtures across multiple test files

- Define the fixtures in `conftest.py`

### conftest.py

- conftest.py is used to fixtures, hooks, and other configurations
- These are then are shared across multiple test files within a pytest test suite.
- Location: same place where all the testfiles are located, such as `tests`

### Fixtures, Hooks, Configurations

- **Fixtures**: Fixtures are functions that provide a set of preconditions necessary for running tests. For example, you might create a fixture that sets up a database connection or prepares some data for your tests. Fixtures defined in conftest.py can be used in multiple test files without duplicating code.
    
- **Hooks**: Hooks are special functions in pytest that allow you to customize and extend the testing process. These hooks can be defined in conftest.py to influence how pytest runs your tests.
    
- **Configurations**: You can use conftest.py to set various configuration options for your tests, such as command-line options, plugin configuration, and more.
    

```python
import pytest

# Define a fixture
@pytest.fixture
def database_connection():
   # Code to set up a database connection
   connection = connect_to_database()
   yield connection
   # Code to tear down the database connection

# Configuration options
def pytest_addoption(parser):
   parser.addoption("--runslow", action="store_true", help="Run slow tests")

# Hook to skip slow tests if not requested
def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):
   if not config.getoption("--runslow"):
       skip_slow = pytest.mark.skip(reason="Need --runslow option to run this test")
       for item in items:
           if "slow" in item.keywords:
               item.add_marker(skip_slow)

```

### A simple example of Hook

```python
# conftest.py

import pytest

# Define a custom hook that modifies test items
def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):
    for item in items:
        # Add a custom marker to all test items
        item.add_marker(pytest.mark.custom_marker)

# Define a simple test function that uses the custom marker
@pytest.mark.custom_marker
def test_example():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

In this example:

- We define a custom hook, `pytest_collection_modifyitems`, in the conftest.py file. This hook is called when pytest is collecting test items before the tests are run.
- Inside the hook, we iterate through all the test items (test functions, in this case) in the items list.
- We add a custom marker, `pytest.mark.custom_marker,` to each test item using the `add_marker` method. Markers are used to categorize and filter tests, and you can create your own custom markers to provide metadata or special behavior to your tests.
- In the `test_example` function, we apply the custom marker we defined earlier to the test. This is just an example to show how the custom marker can be used.

When tests are run, pytest will automatically call the `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook, and all the test functions (in this case, just test_example) will have the `custom_marker` applied to them. You can use this marker to filter or customize the behavior of specific tests, or to provide additional information about the tests.

### Doing some task before and after running test

- Use `pytest_sessionstart` &Â  `pytest_sessionfinish` methods in conftest.py

```python
def pytest_sessionstart(session):
    print("session start")
    os.environ["CURRENT_ENV"] = "test"

def pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus):
    print("session finish")
    del os.environ["CURRENT_ENV"]

```

### Pytest Configuration Files

- All the config can be specified in the file `pytest.ini`.
- This file should be present at root directory.

```ini
# Ignore directory
norecursedirs = .git .mypy_cache .pytest_cache .tox .venv build dist db __pycache__ .vscode ui
