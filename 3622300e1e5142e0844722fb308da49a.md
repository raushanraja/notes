pytest

# Pytest:
**1. Basic Introduction**
- A Python testing framework
- Allow to create small test and support for complex functional testing
- Install `pip install pytest`
- Some Conventions:
	- **File Naming**: The test files should be named as `test_*.py`
	- **Function Naming**: THe Function within these files need to start with `test_`
	- **Class Naming**: The Class name should also start with `Test_`
		- Must not have an `__int__` method
		- All method should follow `Function Naming` convention
	- **FIle Organization**: Test should be seperated into different files based on what they are testing.
	- Example:
		```python
		# Function Naming:
		def test_my_function():
			assert my_function() == expected_result

		# Class Naming:
		class TestMyFunction:
			def test_case1(self):
				assert my_function(1) == expected_result1

			def test_case2(self):
				assert my_function(2) == expected_result2
		```

**2. Pytest Common Options Usages**
- `pytest` : To run the test, run in the directory where test files  Or `tests` directory exists
- `pytest -v` : To Increase verbosity
- `pytest -k Expression`:  Only run tests which matches given substring expression
- `pytest -m mark`: Only run tests which has `mark` added in test
- `pytest -x` : Exit instantly on first error or failed test.
- `pytest -ff`:  Run the filutes from last run first. 
- `pytest -s` : Do not capture (Pirnt directly to console)
- `pytest --junitxml=path`: Create a JUnit-XML styel report file at given path.

- Example Usages

	```bash
	pytest -k "addition" # Runs tests whose function name has addition in it.
	pytest -k "addition or sub" # Name has addition  or sub in it.
	pytest -k "addition and sub" # Name has both addition and sub in it. 
	pytest --junitxml=path/to/report.xml # Save the result to given xml file
	pytest -m number # Runs the test below with a mark added to it
	
	
  python Code:
	import pytest

	@pytest.mark.number # Adding the mark here
	def test_addition():
		assert 0+2 == 2
