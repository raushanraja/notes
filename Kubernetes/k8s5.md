##### Creating and Accessing Pod Outside the cluster
+ Create a pod manifest 
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: raushanode
spec:
  containers:
  - name: raushanode
    image: raushanraja/raushanode:1.0
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
```

+ use `kubectl apply -f name.yml` to start the pod
+ use `kubectl get pods` to get detail about the pods
+ use `kubectl describe pod podName` to get extra detalis such as `ip`, `ports`

##### Connecting to the pods:
1. using worker nodes:
    + Minikube : `minikube ssh`
    + GKE: `gcloud compute ssh`
2. One-Off Client pod
    + Create a pod, specifically for this purpose
    + Such as:
        + using `curl` image 
        + using `bash` image
3. kubectl port forwarding
+ Using `kubectl port-forward` command
+ Eg: `kubectl port-forward raushanode 8080`
+ `raushanode`: name of pod
+ `8080` : computer port to which we need to forward pod's port.

##### port-forward
+ The `kubectl port-forward` command can also forward connections to services instead of pods.
+ It also has several other useful features. 
+ Run kubectl port-forward --help to learn more.


##### Adding Application configuration
+ Generally `ConfigMap` object is used to add configuration to an app.
+ It can defined in the same yaml file as the container spec.
+ After specification, we add `volumeMounts` and `volumes` to specify that we will be using above defined configuration.
