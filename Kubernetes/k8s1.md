#### Containers:
+ Packing mechanism
+ Best suited to deliver microservices
+ Provides portable, isolated environment
+ Helps in running the application without interference from other application


#### Microservices
+ Lightweight application
+ Written with spefic dependencies, libraries and environment requirements
+ Ensurs everything is packaged with application to run it successfully


#### Container Image:
+ Confines application code,
+ Runtime and all it's dependencies

#### Container Runtime:
+ Conatainer runtime is used to create one or more continer based on the image.

#### Container Orchestrator/Controller/Management
+ These are tools which groups systems together
+ To form cluster where 
+ Container's deploment and management is automated and
+ meets requirements such as:
  + Fault-tolerance
  + On-demand scalability
  + Optimal resource usages
  + Auto-discovery and communication with each other
  + Accessibility from the outside world
  + Seamless updates/rollbacks without any downtime
+ Few Container orchestration tools and services are :
  + Amazon Elastic Container   Service
  + Azure Container Instance
  + Azure Service Fabric
  + Kubernets
  + Marathon
  + Nomad
  + Docker Swarm

#### Why Container Orchestrators:
+ Groups hosts together while creating a cluster
+ Allows communication between continers, irrespective of hosts
+ Binds containers and storage resources
+ Allows container management in cluster based on resource availability
+ Allows implementing policies to make secure access to the application
