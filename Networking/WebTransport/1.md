## WebTransport Main Points:
- Uses HTTP/3 protocol
- Intended for two way communications between client and HTTP/3 server
    - Maybe one of the main difference between webrtc and WebTransport. 
    - As webrtc is meant for peer-to-peer
- Supports both Unrelieable (datagram API) and Reliable (Stream API) data transfer.
- Better newtwork transition (like change from WiFi to Mobile Network) because of Quick's use of Unique connection ID
to handle source and desitination identificatoin. (Where are HTTP/2 uses IP address as identifiers).


## Few advantange of HTTP/3 over WebRTC Server
- Less setup and configuration than maintaining a WebRTC server.
- Simple protol than WebRTC ( which usages ICE, DTLS, SCTP) to get it working.
- Supported inside web worker allowing to improve performance.


### JS Class/Methods
- `WebTransport()` constructor
    - Needs url with https and port explicitly defined.
    - Eg: `WebTransport("https://someaddreese:49999/wt")`
    - Promises:
        - `.ready`
        - `.closed`
