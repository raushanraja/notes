Getting Started Network Programming
August 18, 2024
===================================

Getting started with netowrk programming

Network programming involves writing software that enables computers to communicate with each other over a network. Here are the steps to get started:

### 1. **Understand the Basics of Networking**

*   **IP Addressing:** Learn how devices on a network are uniquely identified.
*   **TCP/UDP Protocols:** Understand how data is transmitted (reliably with TCP, and faster with UDP).
*   **Sockets:** Sockets are the endpoints for sending and receiving data. Learn how they work.

### 2. **Pick a Programming Language**

*   **Python:** Offers high-level libraries like `socket`, `asyncio`, and `http.server` that are great for beginners.
*   **C/C++:** For lower-level control over networking, useful in systems programming.
*   **JavaScript (Node.js):** Ideal for developing networked applications with asynchronous programming.

### 3. **Learn the Basics of Sockets**

*   **Client-Server Model:** Understand how a server listens for incoming connections and how a client initiates a connection.
*   **Socket Programming:** Learn how to create a socket, bind it to a port, listen for connections, and send/receive data.

Example in Python:

```python

import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind to a specific IP address and port
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8080))

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

print("Server is listening on port 8080...")

while True:
    # Accept a connection
    client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connection from {addr} has been established!")

    # Receive data from the client
    data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Received data: {data}")

    # Send a response back to the client
    client_socket.send("Hello from the server!".encode())

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()

```

### 4. **Learn Higher-Level Protocols**

*   **HTTP/HTTPS:** Explore how web servers and clients communicate.
*   **FTP, SMTP, DNS:** Learn about these specialized protocols.
*   **WebSockets:** Real-time communication for web applications.

### 5. **Asynchronous Programming**

*   Learn how to handle multiple connections efficiently without blocking the server. Python’s `asyncio` and Node.js's event-driven model are great for this.

### 6. **Explore Network Security**

*   **Encryption (SSL/TLS):** Secure your connections.
*   **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms.
*   **Firewall and IP Filtering:** Learn basic security practices.

### 7. **Build Projects**

*   **Chat Application:** A simple client-server chat application.
*   **File Transfer:** Implement a server that allows file uploads/downloads.
*   **Web Server:** Build a basic web server to serve HTML pages.

### 8. **Dive Deeper**

*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
*   **Network Protocol Design:** Design custom protocols for specific use cases.
*   **Advanced Sockets:** Work with raw sockets, multicast, etc.

### Resources

*   **Books:** _"Python Network Programming Cookbook"_, _"Unix Network Programming" by W. Richard Stevens_.
*   **Online Courses:** Look for courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or edX.

Starting with simple projects and gradually building complexity will help solidify your understanding of network programming.

__________
I want to program in rust and parse http request, what level is this

Parsing HTTP requests in Rust involves working at the application layer of network programming. 
This task is considered an intermediate level because it requires understanding both networking concepts and the Rust programming language. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Understanding HTTP and Networking Concepts**

*   **HTTP Protocol:** Learn the basics of HTTP, including request methods (GET, POST), headers, and body content.
*   **TCP/IP:** Understand how HTTP operates over TCP, including how connections are established and terminated.

### 2. **Familiarity with Rust**

*   **Rust Basics:** You should be comfortable with Rust syntax, ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Since HTTP servers often deal with concurrent requests, familiarity with Rust's async features (`async`, `await`, `tokio`, etc.) is beneficial.

### 3. **Working with Libraries**

*   **Hyper:** A low-level HTTP library in Rust that provides building blocks for handling HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Reqwest:** A higher-level library built on Hyper, simplifying tasks like sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

### 4. **Parsing HTTP Requests**

*   **Manual Parsing:** You can manually parse raw HTTP request strings, which involves splitting the request line, headers, and body.
*   **Using Libraries:** Libraries like `hyper` or `http` provide types and methods to parse requests more safely and efficiently.

### Example Using `hyper`:
Here's a simple example of a basic HTTP server in Rust using the `hyper` library that parses incoming requests:
```rust

use hyper::service::{make_service_fn, service_fn};
use hyper::{Body, Request, Response, Server};
use std::convert::Infallible;

async fn handle_request(req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> {
    // Parse the HTTP method, path, and headers
    let method = req.method();
    let uri = req.uri();
    let headers = req.headers();

    println!("Received request: {} {}", method, uri);
    for (key, value) in headers {
        println!("Header: {}: {:?}", key, value);
    }

    // Build a response
    let response = Response::new(Body::from("Hello, world!"));
    Ok(response)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let make_svc = make_service_fn(|_conn| {
        async {
            Ok::<_, Infallible>(service_fn(handle_request))
        }
    });

    let addr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000).into();
    let server = Server::bind(&addr).serve(make_svc);

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);

    if let Err(e) = server.await {
        eprintln!("Server error: {}", e);
    }
}

```

### Key Concepts in the Example:

*   **Asynchronous Server:** The server is asynchronous, handling multiple requests concurrently.
*   **Request Parsing:** The `Request` object provides access to the HTTP method, URI, headers, and body.
*   **Response Building:** The server responds with a simple "Hello, world!" message.

### Further Learning

*   **Rust and Hyper Documentation:** To deepen your understanding of HTTP handling in Rust.
*   **Rust Async Programming:** Understanding Rust's async/await model will help you build more efficient and responsive servers.

This level of programming typically suits those who are comfortable with the basics of Rust and are ready to start working with network protocols and asynchronous programming.

___________
Manually parsing, 
Manually parsing HTTP requests is indeed a good way to deeply understand the structure of these requests and how protocols work at a lower level. 
By doing this, you'll gain valuable insights into how data is transmitted and how different components of a request fit together. 
This approach can be applied to other types of requests, making you more versatile in handling different network protocols.

### Benefits of Manually Parsing HTTP Requests:

1.  **Deep Understanding:** You'll gain a strong grasp of the HTTP protocol, including request lines, headers, and body parsing.
2.  **Flexibility:** Once you understand how to manually parse HTTP requests, you can adapt this knowledge to other protocols like FTP, SMTP, or custom protocols.
3.  **Debugging Skills:** Parsing manually helps you understand common issues, making you better at debugging and troubleshooting network communication problems.
4.  **Learning Opportunity:** You’ll learn about string manipulation, error handling, and the importance of efficiency in parsing large or frequent requests.

### How to Manually Parse an HTTP Request in Rust:

Here’s how you can start:

#### 1. **Understand the Structure of an HTTP Request:**

*   **Request Line:** Contains the HTTP method, URI, and HTTP version (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`).
*   **Headers:** Key-value pairs providing metadata (e.g., `Host: example.com`).
*   **Body:** Optional, contains data sent in POST requests.

#### 2. **Break Down the Request into Parts:**

```rust

fn parse_http_request(request: &str) {
    // Split the request into lines
    let lines: Vec<&str> = request.lines().collect();

    // Parse the request line
    let request_line = lines[0];
    let parts: Vec<&str> = request_line.split_whitespace().collect();
    let method = parts[0];
    let uri = parts[1];
    let version = parts[2];

    println!("Method: {}", method);
    println!("URI: {}", uri);
    println!("Version: {}", version);

    // Parse headers
    let mut headers = Vec::new();
    for line in &lines[1..] {
        if line.is_empty() {
            break; // End of headers
        }
        headers.push(line);
    }

    println!("Headers:");
    for header in headers {
        println!("{}", header);
    }

    // Parse body if any
    let body_start = headers.len() + 2;
    if lines.len() > body_start {
        let body = &lines[body_start..].join("\n");
        println!("Body: {}", body);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let request = "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n";
    parse_http_request(request);
}


```

#### 3. **Learn and Apply the Parsing Logic:**

*   **String Splitting:** Use Rust’s string manipulation functions to split and analyze each part of the request.
*   **Error Handling:** Anticipate and handle errors, like malformed requests or missing components.
*   **Efficiency:** Consider performance when parsing large requests or handling many connections.

### Applying to Other Protocols:

Once you’ve manually parsed HTTP requests, you can apply similar techniques to other protocols:

*   **FTP:** Parse commands like `USER`, `PASS`, and file paths.
*   **SMTP:** Handle `HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, and `RCPT TO` commands.
*   **Custom Protocols:** Design and implement your own request/response formats.

### Conclusion:

This methodical approach to learning by manually parsing is an excellent way to build a deep understanding of network protocols and data handling. It’s more challenging, but the knowledge you gain will be invaluable, especially when you need to work with protocols that don't have established libraries or when debugging complex issues.

##### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

When manually parsing HTTP requests in Rust, you’ll need to define a struct to represent the parsed data, manage string manipulation carefully, and ensure that your code is safe, efficient, and idiomatic. Here’s a guide on how to structure your Rust code and what to keep in mind:

### 1. **Define a Struct to Represent an HTTP Request**

*   A struct will help you organize the different parts of the HTTP request, such as the method, URI, headers, and body.
```rust

use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct HttpRequest {
    method: String,
    uri: String,
    version: String,
    headers: HashMap<String, String>,
    body: Option<String>,
}


```

### 2. **String Manipulation and Parsing**

*   Rust’s string handling is strict due to its ownership and borrowing rules. Pay attention to how you slice strings and handle their lifetimes.
```rust

fn parse_http_request(request: &str) -> Result<HttpRequest, &'static str> {
    let mut lines = request.lines();

    // Parse the request line
    let request_line = lines.next().ok_or("Request line missing")?;
    let parts: Vec<&str> = request_line.split_whitespace().collect();
    if parts.len() != 3 {
        return Err("Invalid request line format");
    }

    let method = parts[0].to_string();
    let uri = parts[1].to_string();
    let version = parts[2].to_string();

    // Parse headers
    let mut headers = HashMap::new();
    for line in lines.by_ref() {
        if line.is_empty() {
            break; // End of headers
        }
        let mut header_parts = line.splitn(2, ':');
        let key = header_parts.next().unwrap().trim().to_string();
        let value = header_parts.next().unwrap().trim().to_string();
        headers.insert(key, value);
    }

    // Parse body
    let body = lines.collect::<Vec<&str>>().join("\n");
    let body = if body.is_empty() { None } else { Some(body) };

    Ok(HttpRequest {
        method,
        uri,
        version,
        headers,
        body,
    })
}


```


### 3. **Error Handling**

*   Rust emphasizes robust error handling. Use `Result` and `Option` to handle possible parsing errors gracefully.
```rust

fn main() {
    let request = "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n";
    match parse_http_request(request) {
        Ok(parsed_request) => println!("{:?}", parsed_request),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to parse request: {}", e),
    }
}

```

### 4. **Borrowing and Lifetimes**

*   When working with strings and slices, ensure you manage lifetimes correctly. Rust’s compiler will guide you, but understanding lifetimes is key to preventing dangling references or overly restrictive borrowing.

### 5. **Memory Safety**

*   Ensure that your code is memory safe, avoiding common issues like buffer overflows. Rust’s ownership system helps here, but be mindful when manipulating raw data.

### 6. **Idiomatic Rust**

*   Write idiomatic Rust code by using common patterns and structures:
    *   **Use Enums for HTTP Methods:** Represent HTTP methods with an enum for type safety.
    *   **Pattern Matching:** Leverage Rust’s pattern matching to handle different cases, like parsing headers or detecting an empty body.
    *   **Iterators:** Use Rust’s powerful iterator methods (like `map`, `filter`, `collect`) for clean and efficient data processing.

### 7. **Efficiency Considerations**

*   **String Allocation:** Avoid unnecessary string allocations and copies. Use `&str` slices where possible instead of `String`.
*   **Lazy Evaluation:** Parse only what you need, especially in large requests. For example, delay parsing the body until it’s necessary.

### 8. **Testing**

*   Write unit tests for your parsing functions. Testing different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, malformed requests) ensures your parser is robust.

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_parse_http_request() {
        let request = "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n";
        let parsed = parse_http_request(request).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(parsed.method, "GET");
        assert_eq!(parsed.uri, "/index.html");
        assert_eq!(parsed.version, "HTTP/1.1");
        assert_eq!(parsed.headers.get("Host"), Some(&"example.com".to_string()));
        assert!(parsed.body.is_none());
    }
}



```

### 9. **Documentation**

*   Document your structs and functions clearly. This helps in maintaining and expanding your code, especially in complex parsing scenarios.

### Conclusion

Manually parsing HTTP requests in Rust involves careful handling of strings, memory safety, and a deep understanding of Rust’s ownership model. By keeping these principles in mind and following idiomatic Rust practices, you'll not only become proficient in parsing HTTP requests but also lay a solid foundation for parsing other types of network protocols.

__________

What's when we are trying to form a request

When you're forming an HTTP request in Rust, you'll essentially be constructing a string that adheres to the HTTP protocol format. 
This involves assembling the request line, headers, and body, and ensuring everything is properly formatted according to HTTP standards.

Here's what to consider when forming an HTTP request in Rust:

### 1. **Define a Struct for the HTTP Request**

*   Similar to parsing, you’ll want to define a struct that represents the various components of an HTTP request.
```rust

use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct HttpRequest {
    method: String,
    uri: String,
    version: String,
    headers: HashMap<String, String>,
    body: Option<String>,
}


```

### 2. **Implement a Method to Form the HTTP Request**

*   Create a method for the `HttpRequest` struct that constructs the raw HTTP request string from its components.
```rust

impl HttpRequest {
    fn new(method: &str, uri: &str) -> Self {
        HttpRequest {
            method: method.to_string(),
            uri: uri.to_string(),
            version: "HTTP/1.1".to_string(),
            headers: HashMap::new(),
            body: None,
        }
    }

    fn add_header(&mut self, key: &str, value: &str) {
        self.headers.insert(key.to_string(), value.to_string());
    }

    fn set_body(&mut self, body: &str) {
        self.body = Some(body.to_string());
        self.add_header("Content-Length", &body.len().to_string());
    }

    fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        let mut request = format!("{} {} {}\r\n", self.method, self.uri, self.version);

        for (key, value) in &self.headers {
            request.push_str(&format!("{}: {}\r\n", key, value));
        }

        request.push_str("\r\n");

        if let Some(ref body) = self.body {
            request.push_str(body);
        }

        request
    }
}

```

### 3. **Constructing an HTTP Request**

*   Use the struct and methods to build an HTTP request.

```rust

fn main() {
    let mut request = HttpRequest::new("GET", "/index.html");
    request.add_header("Host", "example.com");
    request.add_header("Connection", "close");

    // Optional: set a body for methods like POST
    // request.set_body("name=value&anothername=anothervalue");

    let raw_request = request.to_string();
    println!("{}", raw_request);
}

```

### 4. **Key Considerations**

*   **Method and URI:** Ensure the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the URI are correctly set.
*   **HTTP Version:** Typically, this will be `HTTP/1.1` unless you're working with HTTP/2 or another version.
*   **Headers:** Add headers using a key-value structure. Remember that some headers, like `Host` and `Content-Length`, are required.
*   **Body:** For requests like POST, PUT, or PATCH, include a body. Ensure the `Content-Length` header matches the body’s byte length.
*   **Proper Formatting:** Use `\r\n` to separate the request line, headers, and body.

### 5. **Sending the Request**

*   Once you’ve formed the HTTP request string, you’ll need to send it over a TCP connection. Here’s a simple example of sending the request:

```rust

use std::io::{Read, Write};
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() {
    let mut request = HttpRequest::new("GET", "/index.html");
    request.add_header("Host", "example.com");
    request.add_header("Connection", "close");

    let raw_request = request.to_string();

    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("example.com:80").expect("Could not connect to server");

    stream.write_all(raw_request.as_bytes()).expect("Failed to send request");

    let mut response = String::new();
    stream.read_to_string(&mut response).expect("Failed to read response");

    println!("Response: {}", response);
}


```


### 6. **Error Handling and Safety**

*   Handle potential errors when forming and sending the request, such as connection failures or malformed requests.
*   Consider using enums for HTTP methods to enforce valid input.

### 7. **Efficiency and Best Practices**

*   **Reuse Connections:** For performance, consider keeping the TCP connection open for multiple requests (HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive).
*   **Request Method Safety:** If you're forming requests programmatically, ensure that only valid HTTP methods are used.
*   **Security Considerations:** When sending sensitive data in the body, ensure proper encryption (use HTTPS instead of HTTP).

### Conclusion

Forming an HTTP request in Rust involves carefully assembling the request line, headers, and body into a properly formatted string. By structuring your code around a Rust struct and implementing methods to build and convert this struct into a string, you gain full control over the request formation process. This manual approach not only deepens your understanding of how HTTP requests work but also prepares you to handle other types of protocol requests in the future.
___________
HTTP is text based protocol?

Yes, the approach I described is tailored to HTTP because it is a text-based protocol. 
In a text-based protocol, both the request and response are transmitted as plain text, with well-defined rules for formatting. 
This makes it relatively straightforward to construct and parse these messages using string manipulation.

### Key Characteristics of Text-Based Protocols (like HTTP):

1.  **Human-Readable:** The messages are plain text, which makes them easy to read and debug manually.
2.  **Structured Format:** Text-based protocols often have a clear and predictable structure (e.g., request line, headers, body in HTTP).
3.  **String Manipulation:** You can use string operations to construct, parse, and inspect the protocol messages.

### Binary Protocols: A Different Challenge

However, not all protocols are text-based. Some protocols, like HTTP/2, DNS, or custom network protocols, are binary-based. Binary protocols typically involve transmitting data in a more compact, machine-readable format. Parsing and constructing messages for binary protocols require a different approach:

### 1. **Understanding Binary Formats**

*   Binary protocols often have fixed or variable-length fields that represent different parts of the message.
*   The data may be encoded in a specific format (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, bit flags).

### 2. **Structuring Data**

*   You'll typically use byte arrays or buffers in Rust to represent the binary data.
*   Rust's `struct` types can still be useful, but you’ll often need to convert between the struct fields and the corresponding byte representations.

### 3. **Serialization and Deserialization**

*   **Serialization:** Convert your data structures into a binary format that can be transmitted over the network.
*   **Deserialization:** Convert received binary data back into your data structures.

### Example: Forming and Parsing a Simple Binary Protocol

Let’s say you’re working with a simple custom binary protocol where the message format is:

*   **1 byte for a command**
*   **2 bytes for a length field (big-endian)**
*   **Variable length for the data**

#### Forming a Binary Message:
```rust

fn form_binary_message(command: u8, data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut message = Vec::new();
    message.push(command); // 1 byte command
    message.extend_from_slice(&(data.len() as u16).to_be_bytes()); // 2 bytes length (big-endian)
    message.extend_from_slice(data); // variable-length data
    message
}

fn main() {
    let command = 0x01;
    let data = b"Hello, world!";
    let message = form_binary_message(command, data);

    println!("{:?}", message); // Output: [1, 0, 13, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33]
}


```

#### Parsing a Binary Message:
```rust

fn parse_binary_message(message: &[u8]) -> Result<(u8, Vec<u8>), &'static str> {
    if message.len() < 3 {
        return Err("Message too short");
    }

    let command = message[0];
    let length = u16::from_be_bytes([message[1], message[2]]) as usize;

    if message.len() < 3 + length {
        return Err("Message length mismatch");
    }

    let data = message[3..3 + length].to_vec();
    Ok((command, data))
}

fn main() {
    let message = vec![0x01, 0x00, 0x0D, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33];
    match parse_binary_message(&message) {
        Ok((command, data)) => {
            println!("Command: {:#X}, Data: {:?}", command, String::from_utf8(data).unwrap());
        }
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to parse message: {}", e),
    }
}


```

### Key Differences:

*   **Byte-Level Manipulation:** Instead of string operations, you’re working directly with bytes. You must be careful with endianess, alignment, and padding.
*   **Efficiency:** Binary protocols are generally more compact and efficient for machine-to-machine communication, but they’re harder to debug without specialized tools.
*   **Rust's Support:** Rust provides strong support for low-level memory and byte manipulation, making it a great language for handling binary protocols safely and efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The approach to forming and parsing protocol messages depends heavily on whether the protocol is text-based or binary. Text-based protocols like HTTP can be managed with string manipulation, while binary protocols require careful byte-level operations. By understanding both types of protocols, you'll be well-equipped to handle a wide range of networking tasks.

___________
DNS what sort of protocol is this?

DNS (Domain Name System) is a **binary protocol** primarily used for translating human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`), 
which computers use to identify each other on the network. It operates over both UDP and TCP, typically using port 53.

### Key Characteristics of DNS:

1.  **Binary Protocol:**
    
    *   DNS messages are transmitted in a binary format, meaning the data is encoded in a compact, machine-readable form rather than as human-readable text.
2.  **Request-Response Model:**
    
    *   DNS operates on a simple request-response model. A client sends a DNS query to a DNS server, and the server responds with the corresponding IP address or other relevant information.
3.  **Use of UDP and TCP:**
    
    *   DNS queries are usually sent over UDP (User Datagram Protocol) because it's faster for small queries. However, DNS can use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for tasks like zone transfers (when copying a large set of DNS records between servers) or when the response data size exceeds the typical UDP packet size.

### DNS Message Structure:

A DNS message consists of several sections, all of which are binary-encoded:

1.  **Header (12 bytes):**
    
    *   **Transaction ID:** 16-bit identifier to match requests and responses.
    *   **Flags:** 16 bits that include information about the query type, response code, etc.
    *   **Counts:** Four 16-bit fields that indicate the number of entries in each of the following sections.
2.  **Question Section:**
    
    *   Contains the domain name being queried, the query type (e.g., A for IPv4 address, AAAA for IPv6 address), and the class (usually IN for Internet).
3.  **Answer Section (Optional):**
    
    *   Contains resource records answering the question. This includes the IP address corresponding to the queried domain name.
4.  **Authority Section (Optional):**
    
    *   Provides authoritative information about the domain.
5.  **Additional Section (Optional):**
    
    *   Contains additional information related to the query that might help the client.

### Example of a DNS Query in Binary:

*   A DNS query for the IP address of `example.com` (record type `A`) would be a binary-encoded message sent to a DNS server. The message would include the domain name encoded in a specific format, the query type (`A` record), and other necessary fields.

### Tools and Techniques for Working with DNS:

*   **WireShark:** A network protocol analyzer that can capture and display DNS messages in both binary and human-readable formats.
*   **Rust Crates:** For Rust, crates like `trust-dns` or `dns-parser` can be used to work with DNS queries and responses programmatically.
*   **DNS Libraries:** These can help with constructing, sending, and parsing DNS messages.

### Parsing and Constructing DNS Messages in Rust:

*   Working with DNS in Rust involves handling byte arrays and ensuring correct interpretation of the binary data according to the DNS protocol specification. This involves understanding the structure of DNS packets, including how domain names are encoded, and handling different types of resource records.

### Conclusion:

DNS is a binary protocol, and working with it requires knowledge of how to interpret and manipulate binary data. Unlike text-based protocols like HTTP, 
DNS messages are compact, efficient, and designed for machine-to-machine communication. Understanding DNS at this level enables you to build and troubleshoot DNS-related applications and services effectively.
