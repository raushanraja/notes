2_6_Standard Library Traits

## Topics

- `Comparators` : For comparing (==,&lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,=&gt;)
- `Operators` : Operator Overloading  
    \- `Form & Into` : Conversion from and into another type
- `Casting` : Explicit casting, exercise caution
- `Read & Write` : Operation on u8 source, sink
- `Default, struct update syntax` : Produces a default value type
- `Closures` : `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` traits

## 1\. Comparators

- Imported from `std::cmp::`
- In rust comparision operator like (`==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are implemented through traits rather than built-in operator.
- `#[derive]` Can be used to automatically derive comparison traits for custom type, as long as the fields within those custom type also implement comparison traits.
- These traits are called Comparator and actual traits responsieble for this are
    - `PartialEq`
    - `PartialOrd`
    - `Ord`

### 1.1 PartialEq trait

- Used for testing equalitry between two values.
- Defines `eq` and `ne` method for checking if they are equal or not.
- The `==` and `!=`operators will call these methods.

### 1.2 PartialOrd trait

- Used for comparing values.
- It defines following methods
    - `partial_cmp` : required
    - `lt`
    - `le`
    - `gt`
    - `ge`
- The `<`, `<=`, `>=` , and `>` operators.

### 1.3 Ord trait

- Defines a strict ordering between values, and it returns an `Ordering` enum from the methods.
- It defines following methods:
    - `cmp` : required
    - `max`
    - `min`
    - `clamp`
- The Ordering enum has three variants:
    - `Less`: Indicates that the first value is less than the second.
    - `Equal`: Indicates that the two values are equal.
    - `Greater`: Indicates that the first value is greater than the second.

### 1.4 Example

```rust
## Hereâ€™s an example where you want to sort people by height only, disregarding name and id
use std::cmp::Ordering;
#[derive(Eq)]
stuct Person{
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    height: u32
}

impl PartialEq for Person {
    fn eq(&self, other &Self) -> bool {
        self.height == other.height
    }
}
    
impl PartialOrd for Person {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

impl Ord for Person {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        self.height.cmp(&other.height)
    }
}
```

## 2\. Operators

- In rust operator overloading is implemented via traits in `std::ops`.

### 2.1 Example

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl std::ops::Add for Point {
    type Output = Self;

    fn add(self, other: Self) -> Self {
        Self { x: self.x + other.x, y: self.y + other.y }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    let p2 = Point { x: 100, y: 200 };
    println!("{:?} + {:?} = {:?}", p1, p2, p1 + p2);
}
```

## 3\. From & Into

- Types implement From and Into to facilitate type conversions.
- `Form` defines `from` method, and `Into` : `into` method
- `Into<String>` type can be used in method parameters, which allow for a more flexible interface where callers can pass various types that can be converted into a String.

### 3.1 `TryFrom` and `TryInto`

- Similar to From & Into, these are traits for conversions.
- Where it differs is that, these are used for falliable conversions and returns `Result`
- They defines `try_from` and `try_info` method

### 3.2 Example

```rust
// A Custom Type
struct MyNumber(i32);

// Implement From<i32> for MyNumber
impl From<i32> for MyNumber{
    fn from(value:i32) -> Self{
        MyNumber(value)
    }
}

// Implement Into<i32> for MyNumber
impl Into<i32> for MyNumber {
    fn into(self) -> i32 {
        self.0
    }
}


fn main(){
      // Conversion from MyNumber to i32 using Into trait
    let num1:i32 = MyNumber(32).into();
    
      // Conversion from i32 to MyNumber using From trait
    let num2 = MyNumber(100); // Or MyNumber::from(100);

    println!("num1: {}", num1);
    println!("num2: {:?}", num2);
}
```

### 3.3 Example: passing anything convertible into a String

```rust
fn print_string<T:Into<String>>( greet: T){
    let string_value : String = s.into();
    println!("{}", string_value);
}

fn main(){
    let string_literal = "Hello";
    let string_obj = String::from("World");
    
    print_string(string_literal);
    print_string(string_obj);
}
```

## 4\. Casting

- Rust does not have implicit conversion but does support explicit casts with `as`.
- There are limitations while performing type casting in Rust and
- Not all data types are converted to one another.
    - For example, we cannot convert a floating type to a character.
    - \`println!("character = {}", 65.321 as char);
- When casting, lengths are not adjusted.
    - Eg: `*const [u16] as *const [u8]` creates a slice that only includes half of the original memory.
- Non Transitive
    - Casting is not transitive, that is, even if e as U1 as U2 is a valid expression, e as U2 is not necessarily so.
- Casting between data types can potentially lead to data loss or unexpected behaviour, so a caution should be exercised.

### 4.1 Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let value: i64 = 1000;
    println!("as u16: {}", value as u16);
    println!("as i16: {}", value as i16);
    println!("as u8: {}", value as u8);
}
```

## 5\. Read & Write

- Read and Write traits are mainly used to implement working with u8 sources & sinks.
- `use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, Read, Result};`

### 5.1 Using `Read` and `BufRead` for `u8` source

```rust
use std::io::{BufRead, BUfReader, Read, Result};

fn count_lines<R:Read>(reader: R) -> usize{
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(reader);
    buf_reader.lines().count()
}

fn main(){
    let slice: &[u8] = b"foo\nbar\nbaz\n";
    println!("Lines in slice: {}", count_lines(slice));
}
```

### 5.2 Using `Write` on `u8` sink

```rust
use std::io::{Result, Write};

fn log<W: Write>(writer:&mut W, msg: &str) -> Result<()> {
    writer.write_all(msg.as_bytes())?;
    writer.write_all("\n".as_bytes())
}

fn main(){
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    log(&mut buffer, "Hello");
    log(&mut buffer, "World");
    println!("Logged: {:?}", buffer);
}
```

## 6\. Default Trait

- It produces a default value for a type.
- The `..` syntax is called struct update syntax.

### 6.1 Example

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct Derived {
    x: u32,
    y: String,
    z: Implemented,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Implemented(String);

impl Default for Implemented {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self("John Smith".into())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let default_struct = Derived::default();
    println!("{default_struct:#?}");

    let almost_default_struct =
        Derived { y: "Y is set!".into(), ..Derived::default() };
    println!("{almost_default_struct:#?}");

    let nothing: Option<Derived> = None;
    println!("{:#?}", nothing.unwrap_or_default());
}
```

## 7\. Clouser Traits

- Closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding environment.
- Rust provides three traits to represent closures based on how they capture variables and how they can be invoked.:
    - `Fn`,
    - `FnMut`
    - `FnOnce`

### 7.1 `Fn`

Closures that implement the `Fn` trait, capture variables from the enclosing scope by immutable reference. This means they can borrow variables from the surrounding environment but cannot modify them.

### 7.2 `FnMut`

Closures that implement the `FnMut` trait, capture variables from the enclosing scope by mutable reference. This allows them to both borrow and modify variables from the surrounding environment.

### 7.3`FnOnce`

Closures that implement the `FnOnce` trait, consume variables from the enclosing scope. They take ownership of the captured variables and thus can move them into the closure, preventing further use of those variables in the outer scope.

### 7.4 Exmple

```rust
fn apply_with_log_fn<F>(func: F, input: i32) -> i32
where
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32,
{
    println!("Calling function on {}", input);
    func(input)
}

fn apply_with_log_fn_once<F>(func: F, input: i32) -> i32
where
    F: FnOnce(i32) -> i32,
{
    println!("Calling function on {}", input);
    func(input)
}

fn apply_with_log_fn_mut<F>(mut func: F, input: i32) -> i32
where
    F: FnMut(i32) -> i32,
{
    println!("Calling function on {}", input);
    func(input)
}

fn main() {
    // Example 1: `Fn` closure
    let add_3 = |x| x + 3;
    println!("add_3 (Fn): {}", apply_with_log_fn(add_3, 10));

    // Example 2: `FnOnce` closure
    let multiply_by_2 = |x| x * 2;
    println!("multiply_by_2 (FnOnce): {}", apply_with_log_fn_once(multiply_by_2, 5));

    // Example 3: `FnMut` closure
    let mut v = 0;
    let mut increment_by_input = |x: i32| {
        v += x;
        v
    };
    println!("increment_by_input (FnMut): {}", apply_with_log_fn_mut(&mut increment_by_input, 3));
}
```

- `apply_with_log_fn` accepts closures that implement the Fn trait.
- `apply_with_log_fn_once` accepts closures that implement the FnOnce trait.
- `apply_with_log_fn_mut` accepts closures that implement the FnMut trait.
