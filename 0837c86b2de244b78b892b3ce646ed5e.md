Why do we don't have multiple inheritance in python?\\\n  \\\n+ In case we have two different parent class with same method, then there is problem of ambiguity to run the method. That's why python does not support Multiple Inheritance.\\\n  \\\n### Inheritance\\\n\\\n+ Inhritance is way of reusing code of already defined class.\\\n+ Provides reusabilty of code.\\\n  \\\n#### Inheritance Types\\\n\\\n+ Single\\\n+ Mutilevel\\\n+ Hierarchical\\\n+ Hybrid\\\n\\\n##### Example of Inheriting from a class\\\n\\\n```python\\\n# Parent Class or Base class\\\n    class parent:\\\n        def __init__(self):\\\n                self.name=\\\"John\\\"\\\n                self.amount=100\\\n        def display(self):\\\n            print(\\\"Name:\\\",self.name)\\\n            print(\\\"Amount:\\\",self.amount)\\\n\\\n# Child or Derived class\\\n    class child(parent):\\\n        print(\\\"Derive class\\\")\\\n\\\n# Creating object of child class and accessinh display() of preant class\\\n\\\n    c = child()\\\n    c.display()\\\n\\\n```\\\n\\\n##### Overriding a Base class method by Derived class method\\\n\\\n+ Define the method with same signature in derived class\\\n+ Use **super()** to use the overridden method in child class\\\n\\\n###### Example Overriding and super( )\\\n\\\n> $Overriding$ Example\\\n>\\\n> ```python\\\n>\\\n>    class Person():                         # Base Class\\\n>        def __init__(self,name):\\\n>            self.name=name\\\n>        def display(self):\\\n>            print(\\\"Name: \\\", self.name)\\\n>\\\n>    class PersonA(Person):                  # Derived class A\\\n>        def __init__(self,name):\\\n>            self.name = \\\"Doctor \\\" + name\\\n>        def display(self):\\\n>            print(\\\"Name: \\\", self.name)\\\n>\\\n>    class PersonB(Person):                  # Derived class B\\\n>        def __init__(self,name):\\\n>            self.name= name+ \\\" Esquire\\\"\\\n>        def display(self):\\\n>            print(\\\"Name: \\\", self.name)\\\n>\\\n>   # Creating objects\\\n>    person=Person(\\\"John\\\")\\\n>    Doctor=Person(\\\"John\\\")\\\n>    Esquire=Person(\\\"John\\\")\\\n>\\\n>    person.display()\\\n>    Doctor.display()\\\n>    Esquire.display()\\\n>\\\n>```\\\n\\\n> $super( )$ Example\\\n>\\\n> ```python\\\n>\\\n>    class Person():                         # Base Class\\\n>        def __init__(self,name):\\\n>            self.name=name\\\n>        def display(self):\\\n>            print(\\\"Name: \\\", self.name)\\\n>\\\n>    class PersonEmail(Person):                  # Derived class\\\n>        def __init__(self,name,email):\\\n>             super().__init__(name)\\\n>             self.email=email\\\n>        def display(self):\\\n>            print(\\\"Name: \\\", self.name)\\\n>            print(\\\"Email: \\\", self.email)\\\n>\\\n>\\\n>    personEmail = PersonEmail(\\\"John\\\",\\\"abc@zyx.com\\\")\\\n>    personEmail.display()\\\n>\\\n> ```\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3452}]"
