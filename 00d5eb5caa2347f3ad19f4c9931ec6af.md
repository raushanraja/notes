2_3_Methods_Traits

### Methods
- Methods are function assiocatated with a type.
- `impl` keyword is used to assocate a function with a type.
- `self`, `&self` `mut self`,  `&mur self`  as the first arguemtn of method specifies the object on which the method acts on. For example This is similar to `self` in python. 


### Traits
-  Traits defines all of the methods that a type must have in order to implement it.
-  Traits can provide pre-implemented method as well.
-  `impl  <trait> for <type> {...}` is the syntax for implementing a type.
-  Traits are similar to interface.


### Traits Object
- Trait object allows for values of different types. 
- What it means is that trait objects are values that store a value of any type that implements the given trait.
- For instance a collection storing values of different type that implements given trait.



### Deriving
- Deriving is the concept of allowing supportted traits to be implmented automatically for a custom type.
- ` #derive[(Trait)]` sytax can be used to acheive the same.
-  For example, serde can derive serialization support for a struct using ``#[derive(Serialize)].
