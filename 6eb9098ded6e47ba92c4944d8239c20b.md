Control Flow

### IF :
- syntax
	```rust
	if(condition) {
		statement;
	}
	```


### IF-ELSE
- syntax
	```rust
	if(condition) {
		statement;
	}
	else {
		statement;
	}
	```

### IF-ELSEIF-ELSE
- syntax
	```rust
	if(condition) {
		statement;
	}
	else if(condition2) {
		statement;
	}
	else {
		statement;
	}
	```

### Loop
- syntax
	```rust
	loop
	{
		statement;

		if(condition)  // Otherwise the loop will be infinite
		{
			break;
		}
	}
	```
 - loop also provides loop label
    - Loop label are used to add a name to the loop that allows to point to speicific loop 
    - This are useful when using nested loop and we want to stop a specific loop, without stopping all
    - syntax:
		 ```rust
		`loopLabel: loop  // backtick before loop label
		{
			statement;
			if(condition)  // Otherwise the loop will be infinite
			{
				break `loopLabel;
			}
		}
		 ``` 


### For Loop
- syntax

	 ```rust
	for var in expression
	{
		statement;
	}

		// expression for array with name a `a.iter()`
		// range expession: a..b: eg: for i in 1..10
	```

### While loop
- syntax

	```rust
	while(condition)
	{
		statement;
	}
	```

### Match
- Rust provides pattern matching via the match keyword
-  Whicn can compare a value to a series of patterns and execute code based on the matching pattern.
- It ensures all possible cases are handled by checking if the value fits a pattern.
- Match arms have a pattern and code that's executed if the value fits the pattern.
- The resulting value of the expression in the matching arm is returned for the entire match.
- Curly brackets aren't needed for short code blocks.
- It can be used like a C switch. 
- Important Syntax consideration:
	- 	The first matching arm is evaluated and no further evaluation done there.
	- 	 all possible values must be covered.
- Types of match usages:
	- Destructuring
	- Guards
	- Binding

#### Destructuring:
- A match block can destructure items in a variety of ways.
    - Destructuring Tuples
    - Destructuring Arrays and Slices
    - Destructuring Enums
    - Destructuring Pointers
    - Destructuring Structures
	
- ##### Destructuring Tuples:

	 ```rust
	fn main() {
		let triple = (0, -2, 3);
		// TODO ^ Try different values for `triple`

		println!("Tell me about {:?}", triple);
		// Match can be used to destructure a tuple
		match triple {
			// Destructure the second and third elements
			(0, y, z) => println!("First is `0`, `y` is {:?}, and `z` is {:?}", y, z),
			(1, ..)  => println!("First is `1` and the rest doesn't matter"),
			(.., 2)  => println!("last is `2` and the rest doesn't matter"),
			(3, .., 4)  => println!("First is `3`, last is `4`, and the rest doesn't matter"),
			// `..` can be used to ignore the rest of the tuple
			_      => println!("It doesn't matter what they are"),
			// `_` means don't bind the value to a variable
		}
	}
	```
 - ##### Destructuring Arrays and Slices
	```rust
	fn main() {
		// Try changing the values in the array, or make it a slice!
		let array = [1, -2, 6];

		match array {
			// Binds the second and the third elements to the respective variables
			[0, second, third] =>
				println!("array[0] = 0, array[1] = {}, array[2] = {}", second, third),

			// Single values can be ignored with _
			[1, _, third] => println!(
				"array[0] = 1, array[2] = {} and array[1] was ignored",
				third
			),

			// You can also bind some and ignore the rest
			[-1, second, ..] => println!(
				"array[0] = -1, array[1] = {} and all the other ones were ignored",
				second
			),
			// The code below would not compile
			// [-1, second] => ...

			// Or store them in another array/slice (the type depends on
			// that of the value that is being matched against)
			[3, second, tail @ ..] => println!(
				"array[0] = 3, array[1] = {} and the other elements were {:?}",
				second, tail
			),

			// Combining these patterns, we can, for example, bind the first and
			// last values, and store the rest of them in a single array
			[first, middle @ .., last] => println!(
				"array[0] = {}, middle = {:?}, array[2] = {}",
				first, middle, last
			),
		}
	}
	```
- ##### Destructuring Enums
	```rust
	// `allow` required to silence warnings because only
	// one variant is used.
	#[allow(dead_code)]
	enum Color {
		// These 3 are specified solely by their name.
		Red,
		Blue,
		Green,
		// These likewise tie `u32` tuples to different names: color models.
		RGB(u32, u32, u32),
		HSV(u32, u32, u32),
		HSL(u32, u32, u32),
		CMY(u32, u32, u32),
		CMYK(u32, u32, u32, u32),
	}

	fn main() {
		let color = Color::RGB(122, 17, 40);
		// TODO ^ Try different variants for `color`

		println!("What color is it?");
		// An `enum` can be destructured using a `match`.
		match color {
			Color::Red   => println!("The color is Red!"),
			Color::Blue  => println!("The color is Blue!"),
			Color::Green => println!("The color is Green!"),
			Color::RGB(r, g, b) =>
				println!("Red: {}, green: {}, and blue: {}!", r, g, b),
			Color::HSV(h, s, v) =>
				println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, value: {}!", h, s, v),
			Color::HSL(h, s, l) =>
				println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, lightness: {}!", h, s, l),
			Color::CMY(c, m, y) =>
				println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}!", c, m, y),
			Color::CMYK(c, m, y, k) =>
				println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}, key (black): {}!",
					c, m, y, k),
			// Don't need another arm because all variants have been examined
		}
	}
	```
- ##### Destructuring Pointers
	```rust
	fn main() {
		// Assign a reference of type `i32`. The `&` signifies there
		// is a reference being assigned.
		let reference = &4;

		match reference {
			// If `reference` is pattern matched against `&val`, it results
			// in a comparison like:
			// `&i32`
			// `&val`
			// ^ We see that if the matching `&`s are dropped, then the `i32`
			// should be assigned to `val`.
			&val => println!("Got a value via destructuring: {:?}", val),
		}

		// To avoid the `&`, you dereference before matching.
		match *reference {
			val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
		}

		// What if you don't start with a reference? `reference` was a `&`
		// because the right side was already a reference. This is not
		// a reference because the right side is not one.
		let _not_a_reference = 3;

		// Rust provides `ref` for exactly this purpose. It modifies the
		// assignment so that a reference is created for the element; this
		// reference is assigned.
		let ref _is_a_reference = 3;

		// Accordingly, by defining 2 values without references, references
		// can be retrieved via `ref` and `ref mut`.
		let value = 5;
		let mut mut_value = 6;

		// Use `ref` keyword to create a reference.
		match value {
			ref r => println!("Got a reference to a value: {:?}", r),
		}

		// Use `ref mut` similarly.
		match mut_value {
			ref mut m => {
				// Got a reference. Gotta dereference it before we can
				// add anything to it.
				*m += 10;
				println!("We added 10. `mut_value`: {:?}", m);
			},
		}
	}
	```
-  ##### Destructuring Structures
	```rust
	fn main() {
		struct Foo {
			x: (u32, u32),
			y: u32,
		}

		// Try changing the values in the struct to see what happens
		let foo = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };

		match foo {
			Foo { x: (1, b), y } => println!("First of x is 1, b = {},  y = {} ", b, y),

			// you can destructure structs and rename the variables,
			// the order is not important
			Foo { y: 2, x: i } => println!("y is 2, i = {:?}", i),

			// and you can also ignore some variables:
			Foo { y, .. } => println!("y = {}, we don't care about x", y),
			// this will give an error: pattern does not mention field `x`
			//Foo { y } => println!("y = {}", y),
		}
	}
	```

#### Guards
- In Rust's match expression, guards are additional if conditions added to a match arm pattern.
- These conditions must evaluate to a Boolean value and are separated from the pattern by if.
- The compiler checks that all possible cases are handled in a match expression.
	- And it does take gurard condition into consideration for it.
	- So all possible cases must be covered, and it includes `_` (default) match anything 

	```rust
	enum Temperature {
		Celsius(i32),
		Fahrenheit(i32),
	}

	fn main() {
		let temperature = Temperature::Celsius(35);
		// ^ TODO try different values for `temperature`

		match temperature {
			Temperature::Celsius(t) if t > 30 => println!("{}C is above 30 Celsius", t),
			// The `if condition` part ^ is a guard
			Temperature::Celsius(t) => println!("{}C is below 30 Celsius", t),

			Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) if t > 86 => println!("{}F is above 86 Fahrenheit", t),
			Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) => println!("{}F is below 86 Fahrenheit", t),
		}
	}


	# Another Example
	match value {
		1 => println!("One"),
		2 => println!("Two"),
		3 => println!("Three"),
		n if n > 0 && n < 4 => println!("Value is between 1 and 3"),
		_ => println!("Something else"),
	}
	```

	```rust
	# Note that the compiler won't take guard conditions 
	into account when checking if all patterns are covered
	by the match expression.

	fn main() {
		let number: u8 = 4;

		match number {
			i if i == 0 => println!("Zero"),
			i if i > 0 => println!("Greater than zero"),

			 // Here we are trying to add guard condition and check 
			 // The value is greater or zero, but we are not covering case where
			 // the value can be less than zero. So since not all possible cases 
			 // are covered and since compiler does not take gurad cases into 
			 // cosideration while checking if all cases are covered, it will
			 // give an compilation error 
			 // _ => unreachable!("Should never happen."),
			 // TODO ^ uncomment to fix compilation
		}
	}
	```
#### Binding:
- In rust's match expression we can 
	- Use match bindings to extract values from the matched pattern and
	- Then use them in the code associated with that pattern.
- Match bindings are created by adding `@variable_name` to the end of a pattern 
-  Value that matched the pattern is bound to the variable name specified in the match binding.
-  Value that matched  is available in the code associated with the matching pattern.
-  Example:
	```rust
	enum Message {
		Quit,
		Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
		Write(String),
		ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
	}

	fn handle_message(msg: Message) {
		match msg {
			Message::Quit => {
				println!("Quitting...");
			},
			Message::Move { x: x_pos, y: y_pos } => {
				println!("Moving to ({}, {})", x_pos, y_pos);
			},
			Message::Write(text) => {
				println!("Writing: {}", text);
			},
			Message::ChangeColor(r @ 255, g @ 255, b @ 255) => {
				println!("Changing color to white ({} {} {})", r, g, b);
			},
			Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
				println!("Changing color to ({}, {}, {})", r, g, b);
			},
		}
	}


	// ANother one
	// A function `age` which returns a `u32`.
	fn age() -> u32 {
		15
	}

	fn main() {
		println!("Tell me what type of person you are");

		match age() {
			0             => println!("I haven't celebrated my first birthday yet"),
			// Could `match` 1 ..= 12 directly but then what age
			// would the child be? Instead, bind to `n` for the
			// sequence of 1 ..= 12. Now the age can be reported.
			n @ 1  ..= 12 => println!("I'm a child of age {:?}", n),
			n @ 13 ..= 19 => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
			// Nothing bound. Return the result.
			n             => println!("I'm an old person of age {:?}", n),
		}
	}


	// Another One
	fn some_number() -> Option<u32> {
		Some(42)
	}

	fn main() {
		match some_number() {
			// Got `Some` variant, match if its value, bound to `n`,
			// is equal to 42.
			Some(n @ 42) => println!("The Answer: {}!", n),
			// Match any other number.
			Some(n)      => println!("Not interesting... {}", n),
			// Match anything else (`None` variant).
			_            => (),
		}
	}
	```
#### Joining Multple match pattern
- Multiple match patterns may be joined with the `|` operator. Each pattern will be tested in left-to-right sequence until a successful match is found.
- Every binding in each `|` separated pattern must appear in all of the patterns in the arm. 
- Every binding of the same name must have the same type, and have the same binding mode.
- The 2..=9 is a [Range Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/patterns.html#range-patterns), not a Range Expression. Thus, only those types of ranges supported by range patterns can be used in match arms.
- Example:
	```rust
	let x = 9;
	let message = match x {
		0 | 1  => "not many",
		2 ..= 9 => "a few",
		_      => "lots"
	};

	assert_eq!(message, "a few");

	// Demonstration of pattern match order.
	struct S(i32, i32);

	match S(1, 2) {
		S(z @ 1, _) | S(_, z @ 2) => assert_eq!(z, 1),
		_ => panic!(),
	}
	```
