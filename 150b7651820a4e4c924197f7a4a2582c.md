The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the application directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in [Markdown format](https://joplinapp.org/help/#markdown). Joplin is available as a **desktop**, **mobile** and **terminal** application.\\\n\\\nThe notes in this notebook give an overview of what Joplin can do and how to use it. In general, the three applications share roughly the same functionalities; any differences will be clearly indicated.\\\n\\\n![](:/6ca48c8801bd46feae3166f93453a3bf)\\\n\\\n## Joplin is divided into three parts\\\n\\\nJoplin has three main columns:\\\n\\\n- **Sidebar** contains the list of your notebooks and tags, as well as the synchronisation status.\\\n\\\n- **Note List** contains the current list of notes - either the notes in the currently selected notebook, the notes in the currently selected tag, or search results.\\\n\\\n- **Note Editor** is the place where you write your notes. There is a **Rich Text editor** and a **Markdown editor** - click on the **Toggle editor** button in the top right hand corner to switch between both! You may also use an [external editor](https://joplinapp.org/help/#external-text-editor) to edit notes. For example you can use Typora as an external editor and it will display the note as well as any embedded images.\\\n\\\n## Writing notes in Markdown\\\n\\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Joplin supports a [Github-flavoured Markdown syntax](https://joplinapp.org/markdown/) with a few variations and additions.\\\n\\\nIn general, while Markdown is a markup language, it is meant to be human readable, even without being rendered. This is a simple example (you can see how it looks in the viewer panel):\\\n\\\n* * *\\\n\\\n# Heading\\\n\\\n## Sub-heading\\\n\\\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line. Text attributes _italic_, **bold** and `monospace` are supported. You can create bullet lists:\\\n\\\n* apples\\\n* oranges\\\n* pears\\\n\\\nOr numbered lists:\\\n\\\n1. wash\\\n2. rinse\\\n3. repeat\\\n\\\nThis is a [link](https://joplinapp.org) and, finally, below is a horizontal rule:\\\n\\\n* * *\\\n\\\nA lot more is possible including adding code samples, math formulae or checkbox lists - see the [Markdown documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/#markdown) for more information.\\\n\\\n## Organising your notes\\\n\\\n### With notebooks\\\n\\\nJoplin notes are organised into a tree of notebooks and sub-notebooks.\\\n\\\n- On **desktop**, you can create a notebook by clicking on New Notebook, then you can drag and drop them into other notebooks to organise them as you wish.\\\n- On **mobile**, press the \\\"+\\\" icon and select \\\"New notebook\\\".\\\n- On **terminal**, press `:mn`\\\n\\\n![](:/5c4ab691bb244b8592ebe39c7d6df125)\\\n\\\n### With tags\\\n\\\nThe second way to organise your notes is using tags:\\\n\\\n- On **desktop**, right-click on any note in the Note List, and select \\\"Edit tags\\\". You can then add the tags, separating them by commas.\\\n- On **mobile**, open the note and press the \\\"â‹®\\\" button and select \\\"Tags\\\".\\\n- On **terminal**, type `:help tag` for the available commands.\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3163}]"
