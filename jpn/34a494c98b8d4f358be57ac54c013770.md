1. Point Reflection
+ Consider two points, `p` and `q` . We consider the inversion or point reflection of point `p` across point `q` to be a rotation `180 degrees` of point `p` around  `q`.
+ Given coordinated of both the points, the point after reflection `r` can be found using the mid-point of the line.
+ Here `q` will be the mid-point if the line is rotated 180 degrees, so mid point `q` is: `qx = (px+rx)/2` and `qy = (py+ry)/2`.
+ So, `rx = 2*qx-px` and `ry = 2*qy-py`
