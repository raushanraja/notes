NE555

### NE555 Notes

- Designed in 1971
- It has 8 pins
	1. Ground
	2. Trigger
	3. Output
	4. Reset
	5. Control Voltage
	6. Threshold
	7. Discharge
	8. VCC
- It has 3 operating mode
	1. Bistable 
		- In Bistable mode, once output state is set, the output state does not change unless it is reset.
		- Discharge pin is generally not used.
		- Threshold is also not used.
		- Initially reset is pulled high using resistor R1.
		- Reset has a swtich connected with ground, to pull it low and reset the circuit.
		- Trigger is also pulled high using resistor R2.
		- To change the state, trigger is pulled low for few seconds using a swtich.

	2. Monostabe
		- In Monostable mode, the output state is reverts to it's initial state once the the trigger is removed and  capacitor is discharged.
		- Discharge and Threshold are pulled high using resistor R1 and connected to ground  Capacitor.
		- Resistor and Capacitor connected to Discharge and Threshold determines the time the NE555 will maintain a state after trigger, and then revert back to it's initial state.
		- Reset is not used.
		- Trigger is pulled high using resistorn R2 and a swtich is connected between trigger and ground.

	3. Astable
		- In Astable mode, the output state is not stable and switches between high and low without any external trigger.
		- Discharge is pulled high using Resistor R1.
		- Threshold and Trigger is pulled high using Resistor R2.
		- A capacitor is connected between ground and Threshold and Trigger (Both are connected together)
		- Reset is out used.
		- Frequency of swtiching between high and low depends on R1 and R2.
