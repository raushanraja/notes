### 1. Types of Attack
+ Active attack
  + DOS
  + Breaking into Site
  + Modification
  + Reply
+ Passive attack
  + sniffing
    + password
    + Netwrok traffic
    + Sensitive information
  
 <br/>
 
### 2. Modes of Attack
+ Over the Internet
+ Over LAN
+ Locally
+ Offline
+ Theft
+ Deception

 <br/>
 
### 3. Spoofing
+ In this types of attack, the hacker alter his identiy 
+ and assumes the identity of other person, so that other thinks he is someone else.
+ The attacker explits the trust relation between user and network machines.
+ Types of Spoffing
  + Email Spoofing
  + IP Spoofing
  + Web Spoofing

#### 3.1 IP  Spoofing
+ The attacker spoof the address of another machine
+ And inserts himself between the attacked and spoofed machine to intercept.
+ To ensure he stays in loop and the packet follows a certian path, source routing is used.

#### 3.2 Email Spoofing
+ An attacker sends an email pretending to be someone else.
+ Tpyes:
  + Creating a similar E-mail account as of original.
  + Modifying an email client.
  + Telnet to port 25
#### 3.3 Web Spoofing
+ The attacker resiter an website matching an entity and pretends to be that original entity.
+ Types:
  + `MITM`
    + Acts as proxy between client and server.
    + Compermises router or node
  + `URL Rewriteing`
    + Attacker redirects traffic to another site by rewriting the URL before original.
  + `Tracking State`
    + Tracking presistent state and stealing the authenticatin, attacker assuems victim's identitiy.
    
 <br/>
 
### 4. Denial Of Service (DOS) Attack
  + The process of rendering a system unusable or slow
  + for the legitimate user by overloading the system
  + Types
    + `Crashing the system`: By sending a packet that will crash the system
    + `Exhausting the resource`
    + `DDOS` : DOS involving multiple attack machines.
+ In most cases it is performed by running a script.

 <br/>
 
### 5. Password Attack
+ The process of cracking/obtaining a password
+ Either by eploting a weak password or uncontrolled netwrok modem.
+ Process invloves 
  + `Getting a valid user ID`
  + `Guess and trying` a password untill sucess in login.

#### 5.1 Dictionary Attack
+ Using words from dictionary to crack the password.
+ 70% people usages a dictionary word as password
#### 5.2 Brute Force Attack
+ Trying all the permutation of letter, number & symbol to crack the password.
#### 5.3 Hybrid Attack
+ Words from dictionary and all their variations are used.
#### 5.4 Social Egineering
+ Obtaining password by expliting people to reveal sensitive information
+ And use them to guess the password.
#### 5.5 Shouder Surfing
+ Looking over the shoulders to watch the password.
#### 5.6 Dumpster Diving
+ Going through people's waster to look for paper & documnets.
+ In order to find written passwords and detials that can help in guessing it.

 <br/>
 
### 6. Phising
+ It is a cyter attack.
+ It usages email for the purpose of attack.
+ The goal is to trick email recipient into believing that email is
  + Something they wanted
  + Or requested
+ Eg.: A bank statement from bank needing to click and download the attachment.
+ The attachment can contain malicious exploit that is used to hack the system.

#### 6.1 Ways to indentifing Phising email
+ Request of sensitive Information.
+ Use non-standard domain names.
+ Grammar and Syntax Error
+ Unmatching URL address
+ Unsolicited 1Attachments


 <br/>
 
### 7. Sniffing
+ SNiffin is the process of
  + Monitoring &
  + Gathering all packets that passes through a given network,
+ Sniffing tools are used for this purpose.
+ It is also called `wiretapping` applied to computer networks.
+ Types of sniffing:
  + `Active Sniffing`
  + `Passive Sniffing`
  + 
#### 7.1 Active Sniffing
+ In active sniffing, the traffic is not only monitored
+ But may also be altered in some way.
+ It works in a switch based network.
+ It involves flooding CAM(Content Addresable Memory) by injectin ARP in target network.
+ CAM keepts track of which host is connected to which port.
#### 7.2 Passive Sniffing
+ In this, the packets are not altered and only monitored.
+ It is works in a Hub based netwrok.
+ In Hub based netwrok, the traffic is sent to all the ports.
+ Here, all hosts can see the traffic.

#### 7.3 Hub vs. Swittch
|Hub|Switch|
|:--|:--|
|Operates on `Physical Layrer`|Operates on `Data Link Layer`|
|Broadcast type transmission|Unicast, Multicast Broadcasr|
|Half Duplex|Full Duplex|
|No packet filtering|Packer filtering is provided|
|Not intelligent, hence cheap|Intellignet and expensive|
|Old type iof device|It is newer & sophesticated device|
 
 <br/>
 
### 8. Attack vs. Threat
|Attack|Threat|
|:--|:--|
|Intentinal|Can be intentinal or Uninetational|
|Attemped to cause damage|Has potential to cause damage, but not always results in damage|
|Attack means the chances information was altered|It does not means that information was altered|
|Security attack is action taken against target with intention of doing harm|Security threat expresses potential for occurance of attack|

 <br/>
 
### 9. Identity Theft
+ It occurs when someone uses other's personally indentifying information such as:
  + `name`
  + `ID number`
  + `Credit card number`
+ Without the permission of the actual person to commit fraud or crimes.
+ Steps to reduce Identity theft:
  + `Don't leave trail`
  + `Be private`
  + `Monitoring`
  + `Change password frquently`
  + `Don't reply to suspicious emails`
  + `Protect electronic information`

 <br/>
 
### 10. Malicius Software
+ `Virus`
  + Software with malicious intent.
  + Capable of spreading easily from one to another machine.
+ `Adware`
  + Software finincially supported by displaying ads over the internet.
+ `Spyware`
  + Software designed to monitor user activity.
  + Does not spread like virus.

 <br/>
 
### 11. Virus
+ A computer program that attaches itself to other programm and then spreads.
+ It can vary in ranges from being annoying to deleting important files.
+ Almost all virus are attached to executable. 
+ That means it does not gets activated until done by user.
+ It can spread through by sharing infected files using emails or other medium.

#### 11.1 Life Cycle of Virus
+ `Dormant Phase`
  + Remians idel.
  + Waiting to be activated
+ `Propagation Phase`
  + Starts multipying itself.
  + Can copy itself from one part of disk to another.
  + Each copied file itself will eneter in propagation phase.
+ `Triggring Phase`
  + The virus gets activated and is ready to perform intended action.
+ `Execution Phase`
  + In this stage the actual work is performed.
  + The payload is released that can cause damage to system.

### 11.2 Worms
+ Sub-class of a virus.
+ It can be defined as self-replicating that can fill all the storage on system or network drive.
+ It has the capability to travel from one to another device without any human action.
+ Reuslt in unncessary memory and bandwidth consumption.
+ Blaster worm
  + Allows remote acces to the system
### 11.3 Trojan Horse
+ Named after mythological Trojan Horse.
+ It is malicious program that appers to be useful software 
+ But actually causes damage to the system.
+ The effect of trojan horse varies by the design
  + It can cause annyoance
  + Delete files
  + Provide remote access to hacker
+ They do not reproduce by infecting other files or self replication.

### 11.4 Ways to combat:
+ Update Operating system
+ Use firewall
+ Do not open unsolicited email attachments.

 <br/>
 
### 12. System Hacking
+ Compromise of computer system and software.
+ Done to gain access to target and steal & misuse the sensitive information.
+ Golas of System hacking
  1.  `Gaining access` : Through password cracking
  2.  `Privilage escalation`
         +  `Horizontal` : Accessing resources belonging to peer 
         +  `Vertical` : Access resource at higher level privilege users
  3.  `Executing applicaions`: Executing malliciuos application for gaining admin rights.
  4. `Hiding Files`:
     +  `Rootkit`: Using an application to ivnade detection.
        +  Set of binaries, script and configuration files.
        +  Types: `kernal`, `Software`, `Hypervisor`
     + `Steganography`
       + Hiding information in ohter data/medium.
       + The message is called `overt` and the file is called `covert`
       + Types: `Image`, `Document`,`Audio`,`Video`, `Folder` stegnography
  5.  Clearing tracks
         +  Process of removing evidance of hacking
         +  Done using
            +  `Removal of log`
            +  `Modifying log`
            +  `Removal of all files and folder created`
            +  `Disabling auditing`

 <br/>
 
 
### 13. Enumeration
