I.E, they exists only in the block they are specified.\\\n- Varaible References have a lifetime as well.\\\n- And the lifetime of a `Variable Reference` cannot exceed the lifetime of a `Variable Binding` it borrows from.\\\n- Example:\\\n-\\\n    ```rust\\\n        // Vairable Binding Lifetime\\\n        fn main(){\\\n                // `x` does not exist yes\\\n            {\\\n                let x = 42;\\\n                println!(\\\"X: {}\\\", x);  // `x` starts existing\\\n            }\\\n            // `x` stops existing\\\n        }\\\n            // `x` no longer exists\\\n\\\n\\\n      //  Reference Lifetime\\\n      fn main(){\\\n          {\\\n              let x = 42; // `x` starts existing\\\n              let x_ref =  &x; // `x_ref` starts existing which is a reference to the Variable `x`, also called as `x_ref` borrows `x`\\\n             println!(\\\"x_ref = {}\\\", x_ref);\\\n            // `x_ref` stops existing\\\n            // `x` stops existing\\\n          }\\\n      }\\\n            // `x` no longer exists\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n        // Lifetime of a Reference cannot exceeds that of the borrrowed Variable Bindings\\\n        fn main(){\\\n            let x_ref = {\\\n                let x = 42;\\\n                &x\\\n            };\\\n            println!(\\\"x_ref = {}\\\", x_ref);\\\n            // error: `x` does not live long enough, \\\n            // Because the lifetime of variable x is limited the to internal block only and now the variable x does not exists outside of the block.\\\n            // So, it cannot to borrrowed to a Reference Variable.\\\n      }\\\n    ```\\\n\\\n#### Borrowing Multiple Times:\\\n- While borrrowed, the variable cannot be mutated.\\\n- While borrrowed, the variable cannot be mutably borrrowed.\\\n\\\n\\\n#### Borrowing with Functions\\\n- References in function arguments also have a lifetime.\\\n    - This exists for entire function call.\\\n- A function can be called with borrows (borrrowed variable) that have different lifetime.\\\n- So, to support borrows with different lifetime, \\\n    - All functions that take references are generic\\\n    - Lifetime are generic parameter in the function \\\n\\\n\\\n#### Lifetime\\\n- Lifetime's name start with a single quote, `'` and a name. Eg: `'a`\\\n- There is a special lifetime, named `'static`, which is valid for the entire program's lifetime.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2273}]"
